Frank:  Michelle, Can you help me clean things up before we go?
Michelle:  Sure. Where should I put this cup?
Frank:  Which cup?
Michelle:  The red one.
Frank:  Put it on top of the table.
Michelle:  How about this fruit?
Frank:  Oh, that goes in the refrigerator.
Michelle:  And those pencils? What should I do with them?
Frank:  Bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom.
Michelle:  How about this pen?
Frank:  Give it to me. I need to use it.
Michelle:  What do you want me to do with that paper over there?
Frank:  You can throw that away. I don't need it anymore.
Michelle:  The trash is full.
Frank:  Alright, then please put it in a bag and take it outside.
Michelle:  OK. Now what?
Frank:  I think we're finished. Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door?
Michelle:  Sure.
