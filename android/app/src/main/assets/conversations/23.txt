Kim:  William, do you like studying English?
William:  I like studying English, and I can read well, but speaking can be difficult.
Kim:  It's not that bad. If you talk to your American friends every day, you'll learn quickly.
William:  Can I ask you a question?
Kim:  Sure, what do you want to know?
William:  I have my book from class here. How do you say this word?
Kim:  Laptop
William:  Sorry, I don't understand. What does that mean?
Kim:  A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you. Do you understand?
William:  Yes, I think so. Can you say it again?
Kim:  Laptop.
William:  Laptop. Did I pronounce that correctly?
Kim:  Yes, that's right. That's very good.
William:  Thanks. And this word? How do you pronounce this?
Kim:  That word is pronounced kitchen.
William:  Thanks so much. You're a good teacher.
Kim:  Thanks.
