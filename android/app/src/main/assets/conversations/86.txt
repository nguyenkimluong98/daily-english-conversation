Anthony:  Mandy, did you know Heather called you?
Mandy:  No. When did she call?
Anthony:  Two hours ago, I think.
Mandy:  Two hours ago? Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Anthony:  Sorry, I forgot.
Mandy:  What did she say?
Anthony:  She said she's waiting for you at her sister's place.
Mandy:  OK, I was going to cook dinner first, but I don't think I have enough time now. I'll just warm up some leftovers in the microwave.
Anthony:  OK.
Mandy:  If she calls again tell her I'm gonna to be late.
Anthony:  OK, no problem.
Mandy:  This is very important. Don't forget.
Anthony:  Don't worry. I won't forget.
Mandy:  Actually, would you please hand me my phone? I think I should give her a call now. She's probably wondering where I am.
Anthony:  Sure, I'll get it for you.
