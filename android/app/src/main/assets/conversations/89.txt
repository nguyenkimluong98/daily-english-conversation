Gary:  Hello?
Nancy:  Hey Gary. What's up?
Gary:  I haven't talked to you in a long time, what's been happening?
Nancy:  Well, I don't know if you heard, I just moved into a new apartment in LA.
Gary:  No, I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn't know you'd already found a place. That's cool.
Nancy:  Yeah, I'm really happy about it.
Gary:  Do you have any roommates?
Nancy:  No, not this time. It's a big change for me 'cause I've never lived alone.
Gary:  Don't you think you'll be lonely?
Nancy:  Not really, I have two friends who live in the same building. We all had dinner together last night.
Gary:  Are they students also?
Nancy:  No, they're not students, but there are a lot of students living in the building.
Gary:  Sounds like a nice place.
Nancy:  Yeah, I think it's a good environment for learning English.
Gary:  Well, I'm glad to hear everything worked out.
Nancy:  You should come out here and visit me sometime. There's even a pool.
Gary:  That would be nice. I'll think about it.
