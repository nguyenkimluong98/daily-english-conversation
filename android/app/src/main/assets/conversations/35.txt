Rebecca:  This looks like a nice restaurant.
Scott:  Yeah, it is. I come here all the time.
Rebecca:  Let's sit over there.
Scott:  OK.
Rebecca:  Can you pass me a menu please.
Scott:  Sure. What are you going to have to drink?
Rebecca:  I'm going to have a glass of beer. How about you?
Scott:  I think I'll have a glass of wine.
Rebecca:  Do you want to order an appetizer first?
Scott:  Not really, maybe we can just order some bread.
Rebecca:  OK. What are you going to have to eat?
Scott:  I'm not sure. I haven't decided yet. Can you recommend something?
Rebecca:  Sure, I've had the steak and the lobster before. They're both very good.
Scott:  I think I'll have the lobster. What are you going to have?
Rebecca:  I'm not that hungry. I think I'm just going to have a salad.
Scott:  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. When the waitress comes back, will you order for me?
Rebecca:  Sure. No problem.
