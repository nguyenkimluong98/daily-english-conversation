Jessica:  Hey, I just talked to Jim.
Mark:  What did he say?
Jessica:  He said he had to cancel the meeting this afternoon.
Mark:  Oh, I see.
Jessica:  Is there a problem?
Mark:  No, It's not a big deal. He and I were supposed to talk to some new customers today.
Jessica:  Sorry to hear that.
Mark:  It's OK. This has been happening quite a bit recently.
Jessica:  That's strange. I wonder why?
Mark:  His wife has been sick, so sometimes he has to go home early to take care of her.
Jessica:  I see. How's work been going?
Mark:  Things are slow right now. Would you mind if I borrow your phone, mine's out of batteries and I have to call my boss to tell him about this.
Jessica:  OK, let me go get it. Its in the car.
