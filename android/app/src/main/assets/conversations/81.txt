Paul:  Betty, are you and John still dating?
Betty:  Yeah, things are going really good.
Paul:  Where did you meet him?
Betty:  I met him at the library a couple of weeks ago. We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.
Paul:  Wow, that's a nice story.
Betty:  I was telling Jim about it the other day. He thought it was pretty romantic.
Paul:  Do you two have plans for tonight?
Betty:  Yes, I think we're going to rent a movie. Have you seen anything good lately?
Paul:  I saw Spider-Man the other day.
Betty:  I've heard that's a really funny movie.
Paul:  Are you kidding? That movie's not funny. It's sad. I was crying at the end.
Betty:  You're really sensitive, aren't you?
Paul:  I guess so. Maybe that's why I can't find a girlfriend.
