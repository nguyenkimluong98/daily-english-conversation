Henry:  Judy, your husband has a really nice car.
Judy:  Thanks. It's a lot better than mine, and it's new.
Henry:  Where are you going?
Judy:  We're going to visit my sister in the city.
Henry:  I didn't know your sister lives in the city, when did she move there?
Judy:  About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from the public library.
Henry:  I see. It's almost 5
Judy:  Oh, we're not driving. We're going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.
Henry:  Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.
Judy:  I take the subway to work everyday, so I'm used to it now.
Henry:  Doesn't your mother live in the city?
Judy:  Yes, she's lived there for about ten years.
Henry:  I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper then.
Judy:  I know what you mean. It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now.
Henry:  Have a good time. Next time you're free, give me a call and we'll go play poker.
Judy:  See you later.
