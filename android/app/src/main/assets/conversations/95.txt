Peter:  Hi Liz. Are you working on your webpage now?
Liz:  No, I'm still waiting for you to send me that image file for the homepage?
Peter:  You mean you didn't get it? I sent it to you over an hour ago.
Liz:  Let me check. It's going to take a second 'cause I have to start up my computer.
Peter:  OK. Did you get it?
Liz:  One second. I just have to open my web browser and check my hotmail account.
Peter:  OK.
Liz:  OK, here it is. I got it.
Peter:  How do I find the webpage? I tried to search for it on Yahoo but I couldn't find it.
Liz:  Don't use Yahoo, use Google.
Peter:  I tried that also and it didn't work.
Liz:  If you go to Google and search for my name, you should be able to find it.
Peter:  OK. Let me try that. I see it now.
