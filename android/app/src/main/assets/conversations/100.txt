Sharon:  Hey John, can I talk to you for a minute?
John:  Sure, what's up?
Sharon:  I wanted to let you know about a book club I joined a couple months ago. I know you do a lot of reading so I thought you might want to come with me next month.
John:  Oh, that sounds like fun. When does the group meet?
Sharon:  Usually the last Saturday of the month at 9
John:  No, I think that's ok. What do you talk about in the group?
Sharon:  Well, every month we choose a new book and then during the next meeting we discuss it.
John:  What book are you reading now?
Sharon:  The Kite Runner.
John:  I've heard that's a good book. What's it about?
Sharon:  It is a good book. I'm almost finished. The book is about a boy who grows up in Afghanistan during the 1980s. It's called the Kite Runner because the main character takes part in a kite flying competition.
John:  That sounds really interesting. I'd love to come.
Sharon:  Ok, great. The next meeting isn't for another two weeks, so you still have time to read the book.
