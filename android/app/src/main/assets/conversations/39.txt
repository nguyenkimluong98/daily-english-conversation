Ray:  Hi Maria, did you have breakfast yet?
Maria:  Yes, I ate at the hotel with my son and my husband.
Ray:  Oh, they have good food there. What did you have?
Maria:  I had some cereal, fried eggs and orange juice.
Ray:  How was it?
Maria:  The food didn't taste very good, and actually I don't feel very well now.
Ray:  That's too bad. Do you want to take a break?
Maria:  No, I'm going to go back to the hotel at lunch time to lie down.
Ray:  OK. I'm going to the drug store later. Is there anything I can get for you?
Maria:  No, that's OK. I think if I rest for a little while I'll feel better.
