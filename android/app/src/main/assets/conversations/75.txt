Thomas:  Hi Tracy. What's going on?
Tracy:  Hi Thomas. I'm waiting in line to buy a DVD player.
Thomas:  The line is too long. Why don't you come back tomorrow.
Tracy:  I think you're right. They're going to close soon.
Thomas:  Let's go get some coffee.
Tracy:  OK. Wait a minute, I have to get something out of my purse. Will you hold this for me?
Thomas:  Sure. Oops.
Tracy:  What happened?
Thomas:  I dropped your calculator. Is it broken?
Tracy:  I'm not sure. Let me have a look. No, I don't think it's broken. The button came off though. I can fix it.
Thomas:  Sorry about that.
Tracy:  Don't worry about it. I do that all the time. If it is broken, I have another one in my car.
