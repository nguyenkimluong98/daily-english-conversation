Shawn:  Hi Kim.
Kim:  Hey Shawn, good to see you again.
Shawn:  How have you been?
Kim:  OK, I didn't sleep much last night though. I stayed up until 2AM studying for an exam.
Shawn:  I was up late last night too. The semester is almost over. I've had exams all week.
Kim:  Are you going back to California after you graduate?
Shawn:  I think so. After I graduate I'll probably go back home and try to get a job.
Kim:  Do you know where you'd like to work?
Shawn:  Not yet, but I want to be an English translator.
Kim:  That'd be really cool. I'd like to be a translator too, but I don't think my English is good enough.
Shawn:  Don't worry about that. Your English is better than most of my classmates.
Kim:  Thanks. Where are you going now?
Shawn:  I'm going to study at the library. I have to take an exam tomorrow.
Kim:  Me too. How late does the library stay open?
Shawn:  I think it's open until 11
Kim:  OK, Good luck.
Shawn:  You too.
