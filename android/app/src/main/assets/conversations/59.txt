Tiffany:  Ed, what should we do today?
Ed:  I have been studying all week. I'd like to exercise.
Tiffany:  Me too. Let's go to the gym.
Ed:  Good idea. What are we going to do there?
Tiffany:  We can lift weights or play basketball.
Ed:  I like to play basketball. Are you good at it?
Tiffany:  Not really, but I like to play. I use to play a lot when I was in school, but now there's no time.
Ed:  I know what you mean. I use to play soccer a lot. Do you think we can play soccer there?
Tiffany:  No, there's not enough room. I think it's better if we play outside.
Ed:  OK, maybe we can go play soccer later this afternoon.
Tiffany:  It's too cold outside today. Let's wait until the weather gets a little warmer.
Ed:  OK.
