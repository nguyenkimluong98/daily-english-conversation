Sharon:  Hello?
George:  Hi Sharon it's George again. What time do you think you'll get to the party tonight?
Sharon:  Sorry, what did you say?
George:  Hello, can you hear me? I said what time do you think you'll be getting to the party?
Sharon:  Sorry, I can't hear you.
George:  Can you hear me now?
Sharon:  No, not very clearly. It's really noisy here.
George:  It might be my cell phone, I don't think I have very good reception.
Sharon:  Oh, that's OK.
George:  Can I call you right back?
Sharon:  OK.
