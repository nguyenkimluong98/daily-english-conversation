Patrick:  How do you like the food?
Diane:  It tastes really great. Did you cook it?
Patrick:  Yes. I made it this afternoon. Would you like some more?
Diane:  OK, just a little though. I'm really full.
Patrick:  Oh. Would you like some soup instead?
Diane:  What kind is it?
Patrick:  Tomato and rice. Have you had that before?
Diane:  No. This is my first time. How does it taste?
Patrick:  It's good, try it. What do you think?
Diane:  Wow. It is good. Did you make that also?
Patrick:  Yes.
Diane:  You're a really good cook.
Patrick:  Thanks, next time I'll make chicken soup for us.
Diane:  That sounds good. Did you study cooking in school?
Patrick:  No, I learned by myself. I have a good cook book that I read when I have time.
