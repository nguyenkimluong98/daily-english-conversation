Kathy:  Jim, I heard you took a trip to San Diego. Is that right?
Jim:  Yeah, I just got back this morning.
Kathy:  That sounds really nice. What did you do there?
Jim:  Well, we were only there for three days, so we didn't do too much. We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times. At night we walked around the city with some friends.
Kathy:  Did you take any pictures?
Jim:  Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them?
Kathy:  Sure, I love looking at photos.
Jim:  This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife.
Kathy:  Your daughter looks like her mother.
Jim:  I know, they look very similar.
Kathy:  Where was this picture taken?
Jim:  That was taken at the train station before we left.
Kathy:  Did you have time to go to the zoo?
Jim:  No, not this time. We went there last time.
Kathy:  It looks like you all had a nice time.
Jim:  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
