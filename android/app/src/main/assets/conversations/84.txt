Angela:  Hello?
James:  Hi Sarah, it's James.
Angela:  Hey James, I can't talk now. Can I call you back later?
James:  Sure. Is there a problem?
Angela:  I'm late for work and my car isn't working, so I need to find someone to take me to work.
James:  I can take you.
Angela:  Oh, really? Thank you. That would help a lot.
James:  Do you need me to pick you up after work also?
Angela:  Yes, if it's not too much trouble.
James:  It's no problem. I'm leaving my house now. I'll be right there.
Angela:  OK. I'll wait for you in front of my apartment building.
James:  Do you know what's wrong with your car?
Angela:  I'm not exactly sure. I think there's a problem with the engine.
James:  OK, I'll have a look when I get there. I know a lot about cars. When I was younger my father and I use to fix old cars.
