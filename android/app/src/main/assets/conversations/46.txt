Laura:  Hello?
Jack:  Hi, is Heather there please?
Laura:  Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
Jack:  Is this 617-228-2289?
Laura:  Yes. Who are you looking for again?
Jack:  Heather Johnson.
Laura:  Oh, I thought you said Laura. Sorry about that. This is the right number, but Heather's not here right now.
Jack:  Do you know where she went?
Laura:  She went to the store to buy some groceries. Would you like to leave a message?
Jack:  Yes, would you please tell her Eric Martin called?
Laura:  Hi Eric, this is her roommate Kathy. I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party.
Jack:  Oh, yes. How are you?
Laura:  Good. Heather will be back in about 20 minutes. I'll tell her you called.
Jack:  OK. Thanks.
Laura:  Bye bye.
