Kim:  Hi Peter, can I talk to you for a moment. I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.
Peter:  Where did you hear that?
Kim:  Sara told me.
Peter:  I'm not sure that's true. I haven't heard anything about it.
Kim:  She said that they have already started to lay people off.
Peter:  Doesn't your father work there?
Kim:  Yes, I'm really worried he might get laid off, he just started to work there about three months ago. What do you think I should do?
Peter:  I'd talk to your father.
Kim:  Yeah, but if there was something wrong I don't think he'd tell me. He doesn't like to upset me, but I really would like to know what's going on.
Peter:  So what are you gonna do?
Kim:  Aren't you good friends with the president of that company?
Peter:  Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.
Kim:  Maybe you could call him and see what's going on.
Peter:  Well, I don't know. I guess I could. It's pretty late now, but I'll call him in the morning.
Kim:  OK, thanks so much.
