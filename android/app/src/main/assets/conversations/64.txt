Erica:  Andrew, would you like to play a game?
Andrew:  OK, what kind of game?
Erica:  Lets play cards? Do you know how to play Blackjack?
Andrew:  Yes, that's an easy game. I don't want to play that right now.
Erica:  OK, Do you remember how to play poker?
Andrew:  I think so, but you're going to have to explain the rules to me again.
Erica:  OK. Look at this piece of paper. It has all the rules on it.
Andrew:  OK, yes. I remember now. I think the last time we played this game, you won and I lost.
Erica:  Yes, that was fun.
Andrew:  OK, let's play, but this time I don't want to bet money.
Erica:  OK, we won't bet. We'll just play for fun.
