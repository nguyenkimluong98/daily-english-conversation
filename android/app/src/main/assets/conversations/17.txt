Mark:  Excuse me. Do you know how to get to the mall?
Betty:  Sure, I used to work there. Go straight for about a mile, then turn left at the light. The mall will be on the right.
Mark:  Do you know the address?
Betty:  Yes, the address is 541 Main street.
Mark:  Can you write it down for me please?
Betty:  No problem.
Mark:  Is it faster if I take Highland avenue?
Betty:  No, that way is longer. There are more stop lights on that street.
Mark:  I think you're right. Thank you.
