Dan:  Excuse me.
Maria:  Hello sir, may I help you?
Dan:  Yes. Can I see that shirt on the top shelf please?
Maria:  Sure. Here it is.
Dan:  How much does it cost?
Maria:  50 dollars.
Dan:  50 dollars. That's too much.
Maria:  How about this one? It's on sale for only 35 dollars.
Dan:  I don't like that one.
Maria:  How about the one next to the black gloves? It's very similar to the one you like.
Dan:  That's nice. How much is it?
Maria:  30 dollars.
Dan:  That'll be fine.
Maria:  Is this color OK, or would you like a different color?
Dan:  That blue one's fine.
Maria:  Do you need any more of these shirts?
Dan:  Yes.
Maria:  How many do you want?
Dan:  I'll take two more, a red one and a white one.
