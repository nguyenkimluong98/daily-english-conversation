Julie:  Hey Michael, I'm tired. Would you mind driving for a while?
Michael:  Sorry. I would like to, but I don't know how to drive.
Julie:  Really? You don't have a license? I thought everyone had a license.
Michael:  No, I've lived in cities all my life and when I'm at home I usually take the subway or bus.
Julie:  I see. Do you think you'll learn to drive in the future?
Michael:  Yes. I plan to buy a car next year. I think you need one in the U.S.
Julie:  Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of people in cities here take the bus also.
Michael:  Well, I'd like to travel more. I've been here for a few months already and I feel like I haven't seen anything yet.
Julie:  How are you going to learn to drive? Do you want me to teach you?
Michael:  No, I wouldn't want to trouble you. I've already signed up for a class near my house. It starts next month.
