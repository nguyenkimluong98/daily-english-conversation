Dan:  Wow, I'm really getting fat.
Melissa:  You don't look fat.
Dan:  Yes, but I am. I've gained 10 pounds in the last two months. Look at my stomach.
Melissa:  How much do you weigh?
Dan:  I think about 170 pounds.
Melissa:  What kind of foods do you eat?
Dan:  I usually have pasta for dinner. Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don't have enough time to cook.
Melissa:  I was reading a diet book the other day. It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you'll lose weight quickly.
Dan:  Wow, does that work?
Melissa:  I don't know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.
Dan:  That sounds good, but I'm not sure how long I could do that.
Melissa:  I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you'll probably start gaining weight.
Dan:  Well, I think I'm going to try it anyway. Who's the author?
Melissa:  I can't remember. It's not that popular anymore. When I get home I'll check and give you a call.
