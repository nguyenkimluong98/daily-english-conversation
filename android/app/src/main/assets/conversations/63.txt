Ellen:  Kevin, what would you like to do?
Kevin:  I don't know. Maybe watch TV.
Ellen:  That's a good idea. We're going shopping later so I think you should rest for a while.
Kevin:  I don't think I want to go anymore.
Ellen:  What do you mean? I thought you said we were going shopping.
Kevin:  I know, but I changed my mind. I'm too tired.
Ellen:  Well, I still have a lot of stuff to buy. When do you think we'll go?
Kevin:  Maybe tonight.
Ellen:  OK, would you mind if I use your phone?
Kevin:  Sorry I don't have signal.
Ellen:  Are you kidding? I usually have really good reception here.
Kevin:  My phone is very old and it doesn't work very well.
Ellen:  What if I take it outside?
Kevin:  Yes, that's fine. It works well outside.
