Karen:  Hi Jim.
Jim:  Hi Karen. You look upset, what's wrong?
Karen:  It's nothing. I'm just a little nervous.
Jim:  Is everything all right?
Karen:  Well, I'm having surgery tomorrow on my finger.
Jim:  What's wrong with your finger?
Karen:  I broke it the other day playing basketball.
Jim:  Oh, that's terrible.
Karen:  Yeah, it's been bothering me since that day.
Jim:  Are you afraid of having surgery?
Karen:  Yes. I've never had surgery before.
Jim:  I wouldn't worry. I had to have surgery on my leg last year. Everything went fine.
Karen:  Were you nervous before the surgery?
Jim:  A little. Who's your doctor?
Karen:  Dr. Allen.
Jim:  Oh, I've heard he's really good. I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Karen:  Good. That makes me feel much better.
