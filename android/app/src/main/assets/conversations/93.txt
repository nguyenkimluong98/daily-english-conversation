John:  Oh my goodness.
Amanda:  The president was on the news talking about it earlier.
John:  Was anyone hurt?
Amanda:  I think they said two people were killed.
John:  Oh, that's terrible.
Amanda:  Yeah, I can't believe you hadn't heard about it. They were talking about it on CNN all day.
John:  Oh, I don't watch TV that often.
Amanda:  Don't you watch the news?
John:  No, I usually read the news online, but I haven't had time to turn on my computer today.
