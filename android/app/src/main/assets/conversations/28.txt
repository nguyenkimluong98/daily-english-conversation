Amy:  Paul, what kind of music do you like to listen to?
Paul:  All kinds, but mostly Pop, rock and classical. Why?

Paul:  What kind of music is it?
Amy:  Pop. It's Mariah Carey.
Paul:  When is it?
Amy:  At 8PM tomorrow night.
Paul:  Yeah, I'd like to go. Do you think we should have dinner first?
Amy:  Yes, that's a good idea.
Paul:  Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment.
Amy:  Oh, I think I know the place you mean. We ate there last month, right?
Paul:  Yes, that's right. You have a good memory.
