Frank:  Hello?
Pam:  Hi Frank, it's Pam.
Frank:  Hey Pam, what's up?
Pam:  Not much. Where are you?
Frank:  I'm in the car driving home.
Pam:  When you get home will you send me an email with directions to the party tonight?
Frank:  Sure, no problem.
Pam:  When do you think you'll get home?
Frank:  I don't know, maybe in about 30 minutes or so. There's a lot of traffic.
Pam:  I have to go out soon. Can you just send me a text message with the address instead.
Frank:  OK, I'll do that as soon as I get home.
Pam:  Thanks a lot. Drive carefully.
Frank:  OK, I'll see you tonight.
Pam:  Bye.
