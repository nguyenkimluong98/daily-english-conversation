Receptionist:  Do you have an appointment?
Adam:  No.
Receptionist:  When would you like an appointment?
Adam:  Is today possible?
Receptionist:  Yes. Today is fine. What time would you like?
Adam:  As soon as possible. My stomach really hurts.
Receptionist:  Please wait a moment. I'll see if the doctor is available.
Adam:  OK.
Receptionist:  Sorry, he's with a patient right now. It's probably going to be about another 30 minutes. Would you mind waiting a little longer?
Adam:  No problem.
Receptionist:  May I see your insurance card please.
Adam:  Here you are.
Receptionist:  Thanks. That's going to be 25 dollars for today's visit.
Adam:  Really? I didn't think it would be that much.
Receptionist:  I know how you feel.
Adam:  I'll pay with cash.
Receptionist:  Thank you.
Adam:  Would you please turn on the heat? It's really cold in here.
