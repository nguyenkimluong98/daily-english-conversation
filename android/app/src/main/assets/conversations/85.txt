Donna:  Hey, what have you been doing today?
Robert:  Nothing, just watching TV. I'm really bored. I don't have anything to do.
Donna:  I don't have anything to do either. I didn't do anything today except clean my house.
Robert:  I know. I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but it snowed so much we couldn't go anywhere.
Donna:  I hope it snows all night because I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
Robert:  Do you know anyone who has a camera? I want to take a picture of all this snow.
Donna:  No, I don't know anyone who has a camera.
Robert:  Have you seen Sara today? I think she might have one.
Donna:  No, she hasn't been around all day. She said she had something important to do today?
Robert:  Oh, where did she go?
Donna:  Nobody knows. I called her roommate and she doesn't know either.
