Bill:  Hey Jane, did you get the mail yet?
Jane:  Yes. I picked it up this morning. There were a few bills and a letter from my mother. There was also a lot of junk mail.
Bill:  Was there anything for me?
Jane:  I don't remember, let me check. Yes, it looks like there's something here for you.
Bill:  Who's it from?
Jane:  The American Embassy.
Bill:  My hands are dirty. Will you open it for me?
Jane:  Sure.
Bill:  What does it say?
Jane:  It says your passport is ready. You can pick it up anytime.
Bill:  Do you think you can drive me there?
Jane:  Sure, when?
Bill:  I think we should go get it now. I'm going to wash my hands and then we'll go. Is that OK?
Jane:  That's fine.
