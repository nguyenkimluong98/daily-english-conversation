Steve:  Hey, How's it going?
Jessica:  Not good. I lost my wallet.
Steve:  Oh, that's too bad. Was it stolen?
Jessica:  No, I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi.
Steve:  Is there anything I can do?
Jessica:  Can I borrow some money?
Steve:  Sure, how much do you need?
Jessica:  About 50 dollars.
Steve:  That's no problem.
Jessica:  Thanks. I'll pay you back on Friday.
Steve:  That'll be fine. Here you are.
Jessica:  What are you going to do now?
Steve:  I'm going to buy some books and then I'm going to the gas station.
Jessica:  If you wait a minute I can go with you.
Steve:  OK. I'll wait for you.
