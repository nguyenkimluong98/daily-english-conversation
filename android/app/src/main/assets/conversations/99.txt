Karen:  Martin, who are you going to vote for?
Martin:  You mean for president?
Karen:  Yes.
Martin:  I'm not sure yet.
Karen:  You should make up your mind soon. The election is next month.
Martin:  Yes, I know. I hear about it every day on the news.
Karen:  I'm going to vote for Obama.
Martin:  I think he is a good choice, but I think McCain would make a good president also.
Karen:  I know. They're both good. It's hard to decide. McCain is older but he has more experience. Obama seems to have a lot of good ideas, but some people say he wants to raise taxes.
Martin:  I heard he wants to lower taxes. It's hard to know what the truth is. That's the reason I really don't pay attention to politics.
Karen:  Yes, it can be frustrating, but it's important and it's interesting to watch.
