John:  Hello?
Ann:  Hi John, sorry for calling so late, I hope I didn't wake you up.
John:  Actually, I was just finishing some work. I haven't gone to bed yet.
Ann:  Did you hear Bill got fired yesterday?
John:  No. I didn't hear that. Are you sure?
Ann:  Yeah, Sarah told me this afternoon. She was pretty upset about it.
John:  That's too bad. Bill's a nice guy.
Ann:  Yeah, I know.
John:  Why did they fire him?
Ann:  She didn't say.
John:  I see. Well, if you talk to Sara again, tell her there's a job opening at my company. Bill can have an interview this week if he wants.
Ann:  Oh, thank you so much. I'll call her and tell her.
