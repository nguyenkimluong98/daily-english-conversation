Karen:  I'm going shopping. Do you want to come?
Jason:  I thought you went shopping yesterday.
Karen:  I did, but an old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party. I need to buy a gift for him.
Jason:  I see. What are you going to get him?
Karen:  I really have no idea what he likes. I haven't seen him in a long time. What do you think?
Jason:  Maybe a cake?
Karen:  Well, that's a good idea, but I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.
Jason:  How about a sweater? I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day. Maybe we can go there and take a look.
Karen:  OK, what store was it in?
Jason:  It was at Macy's. I think they're having a sale this weekend.
Karen:  Oh, that's a really nice store. I like the clothes there.
