William:  Excuse me, sir, will you take a picture of us?
Susan:  Sure. This is a really nice camera.
William:  Thanks, my parents gave it to me.
Susan:  How do you use it?
William:  You press this button here.
Susan:  Come a little closer. Wait, that's too close. Move a little to the left. Move back a little farther. OK, stay right there.
William:  Do you mean here?
Susan:  Yes, that's good. Oh, I can't get it to work.
William:  You need to hold down the button for about 3 seconds.
Susan:  OK I got it, are you ready?
William:  Yes.
Susan:  Smile.
