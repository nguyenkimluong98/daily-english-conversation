Jonathan:  Dorothy what are your plans for Christmas?
Dorothy:  Oh yes, it's almost Christmas, isn't it. I'm not sure what I'll be doing then.
Jonathan:  Well, if you don't have any plans, you family could have dinner at my house.
Dorothy:  That's very nice of you, thanks. Have you finished your shopping yet?
Jonathan:  No, I still have to do that. I think I'll go to the mall this weekend.
Dorothy:  It's going to be really crowded at the mall. You should shop online.
Jonathan:  You're right. My family loves to read, so I can probably get them all presents from Amazon.com.
Dorothy:  What do you think you'll get for your wife?
Jonathan:  Probably a romance novel. It seems like she's always reading one of those.
Dorothy:  Don't you think you should get her something a little more expensive, like jewelry or maybe a new computer?
Jonathan:  Maybe you're right. It's hard buying gifts. I think my wife has everything she wants. Maybe I should just ask her.
