Peter:  Kelly, will you help me take these things to the car?
Kelly:  OK, which car do you want me to put them in?
Peter:  Bring them to my wife's car.
Kelly:  Which one is hers'?
Peter:  The blue SUV in front of the Honda.
Kelly:  What should I take first?
Peter:  That chair over there, but please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law.
Kelly:  Don't worry, I won't drop it. Wow, it's really heavy. I don't think I can move it by myself.
Peter:  Let me help you with that. I don't want you to hurt your back.
Kelly:  Where are you taking all this stuff?
Peter:  Didn't I tell you? We're moving to Florida?
Kelly:  You're moving now? I knew you were moving, but I thought you said you were moving next month.
Peter:  Yes, that's true, but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away.
