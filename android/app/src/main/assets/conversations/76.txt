Richard:  Hey, how did you get here?
Jennifer:  I rode my bike.
Richard:  Are you serious? Why did you do that? I could have picked you up.
Jennifer:  That's OK, I didn't want to bother you. I know you don't like to wake up early.
Richard:  That's so nice of you. Aren't you cold?
Jennifer:  No, not really. I wore a coat.
Richard:  What's in the bag?
Jennifer:  It's a special type of apple.
Richard:  Oh. Can I try one? It's very sweet.
Jennifer:  I put sugar on it. These apples are really good. They were only 30 cents each.
Richard:  Aren't those more expensive than the ones at the supermarket?
Jennifer:  Yeah, they're more expensive, but they taste better.
Richard:  Did you buy any other fruit?
Jennifer:  Well, besides the apples, I bought oranges and bananas.
