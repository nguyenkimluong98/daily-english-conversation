Eric:  Hi Anna, come in.
Ana:  Wow, your apartment is a mess.
Eric:  I know, I didn't have time to put things away before you got here.
Ana:  Look! Are those all your clothes on the couch?
Eric:  Yes.
Ana:  Are they clean?
Eric:  Actually most of them are dirty. I haven't done laundry in a while. I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house.
Ana:  My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street. Why don't you go there?
Eric:  I know I should, but that place isn't very convenient. You have to wait for a long time.
Ana:  Yes I know. I have to do it every week. Anyway, are you ready to go?
Eric:  No I'm not ready yet. I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face. Can you wait for a few minutes?
Ana:  OK, but please hurry. I think the restaurant is closing soon.
