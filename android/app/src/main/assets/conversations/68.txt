Beth:  Patrick, why didn't you call me last night? I was worried about you.
Patrick:  Sorry, I was sick. I went to bed early.
Beth:  What's wrong?
Patrick:  I had a cough and my eyes were really dry.
Beth:  Are you better now?
Patrick:  Yes, I'm feeling a lot better. Much better than yesterday.
Beth:  Do you have allergies?
Patrick:  Yes. Last time I went to the doctor, he did some tests and told me I have allergies. It gets worse in the spring.
Beth:  What time did you wake up this morning?
Patrick:  Around 9
Beth:  Are you going to work today?
Patrick:  No. I think I'll just stay home and watch TV. I can work from home today.
Beth:  Good. Get some rest and I'll bring over some food later.
Patrick:  Thanks.
