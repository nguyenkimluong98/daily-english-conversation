Kevin:  Lisa, would you like to go to the library with me?
Lisa:  OK. Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first?
Kevin:  Sure. First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library.
Lisa:  Are we going to walk or drive?
Kevin:  The weather is really nice today. Let's walk.
Lisa:  The weather is good now, but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon.
Kevin:  Alright, then let's take an umbrella. Is your brother coming with us?
Lisa:  No, he's still sleeping.
Kevin:  Wow, it's already 10
Lisa:  Yeah, he didn't come home until 12
Kevin:  I hope he can come later.
Lisa:  I hope so too. I'll give him a call when we get there.
Kevin:  How do we get to the library from here?
Lisa:  It's straight down this road on the left, next to the museum. It takes about 10 minutes.
