Rachel:  Craig, what do you do for work?
Craig:  I'm still a student.
Rachel:  What school do you go to?
Craig:  Boston University.
Rachel:  That's a good school. What do you study?
Craig:  I'm studying English, math, and history. My major is English.
Rachel:  How long have you been studying English?
Craig:  More than six years.
Rachel:  That's a long time.
Craig:  Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school.
Rachel:  No wonder your English is so good.
Craig:  Actually, it's not that good. I can read but I can't speak very well. I haven't had a lot of chance to practice.
Rachel:  I see. Talking with other people is very important.
Craig:  Yes, but I still don't have many friends here yet.
Rachel:  I'm having a party tonight at my apartment. You should come.
Craig:  Oh thanks for inviting me. I'd love to come.
