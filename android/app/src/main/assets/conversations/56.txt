Barbara:  Hi James, it's good to see you again.
James:  Hi Barbara.
Barbara:  Are you here for work?
James:  Yes.
Barbara:  Is Steve with you?
James:  No I'm here alone. Steve couldn't come this time.
Barbara:  How long will you be staying?
James:  4 days. I'm going back on Friday.
Barbara:  My brother and I are getting together for dinner. Do you want to come with us?
James:  Yeah, that would be nice. I have a meeting in an hour. I can meet you afterwards, if that's OK. The meeting shouldn't last long.
Barbara:  That's fine. Who is your meeting with?
James:  The Boston Insurance Company. I'll call you when it's over.
Barbara:  OK.
James:  Can I use your phone? I left mine in the car and I want to call them to get directions.
Barbara:  Sure, here you go.
