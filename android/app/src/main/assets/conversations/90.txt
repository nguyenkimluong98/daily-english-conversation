Amy:  Justin, have you found a girlfriend yet?
Justin:  No, not yet.
Amy:  What about Jenny?
Justin:  She has a boyfriend.
Amy:  Oh, I thought they broke up.
Justin:  No, they're still together.
Amy:  How about that girl from work you were telling me about last year?
Justin:  Who, Emily? She's married now. She got married last month.
Amy:  I see. It seems like everyone our age is married.
Justin:  Yeah, it's not easy.
Amy:  Is there anyone you're interested in?
Justin:  There is one girl I like who lives in my building. I talk to her a lot because she's also studying English.
Amy:  What's she like?
Justin:  She's really nice. She moved here from Texas about 3 months ago.
Amy:  What does she do?
Justin:  She's an accountant.
Amy:  That's a good job. She must be really smart. Have you asked her out yet?
Justin:  Actually we're going to dinner on Friday.
Amy:  Good luck.
