Mrs. Wilson:  I have a stomachache and a headache.
Doctor:  Where does it hurt?
Mrs. Wilson:  Here.
Doctor:  Do you have a fever?
Mrs. Wilson:  No, I don't think so.
Doctor:  OK. Let me look at your throat. Open your mouth. Your throat's red. Does it hurt?
Mrs. Wilson:  Yes. It's sore.
Doctor:  When did it start to feel this way?
Mrs. Wilson:  Last week.
Doctor:  I think you have a virus. It might be the flu. I'm going to give you a prescription for some medicine.
