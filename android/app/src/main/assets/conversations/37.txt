Andrew:  Pam, where's the closest ATM?
Pam:  It's not that far. Do you see that Yellow building over there?
Andrew:  The big one or the small one?
Pam:  The big one.
Andrew:  Yes.
Pam:  It's right next to it, on the right.
Andrew:  Do you know if there's a convenience store around here?
Pam:  I don't think there's one around here. The closest one is on 3rd street, but that's probably closed now.
Andrew:  I really need to get some things before I leave.
Pam:  Well, you could go down to 22nd street. There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day.
Andrew:  Can I take the subway to get there?
Pam:  Yes, but that'll probably take about half an hour. You should just take a cab.
Andrew:  Won't that be expensive?
Pam:  No, from here I think it's only about 5 dollars.
