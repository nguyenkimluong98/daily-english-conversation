Jimmy:  Angela, come in.
Angela:  Happy Birthday!
Jimmy:  Thanks. I can't believe you remembered that.
Angela:  Well, I have a calendar in my computer. It helps me remember things like that. What are you up to?
Jimmy:  I'm reading a book my cousin gave me for my birthday.
Angela:  Let me see. Oh, I have this book at home. I want to give you a present too.
Jimmy:  Wow, it's a guitar. I already have one, but I like this one better. Thank you.
Angela:  You're welcome. Do you know how to play the guitar?
Jimmy:  Yeah, I know how to play. My father taught me when I was young.
Angela:  Will you play it now? I want to listen to some music.
Jimmy:  OK. Do you know this one?
Angela:  Yeah, I've heard that one. I could sing that song when I was in middle school.
Jimmy:  It's an old one. It makes me feel old. When I was in college they use to play it on the radio all the time.
