Tom:  It's almost Christmas. What are you doing this weekend?
Sara:  Nothing special, just working. Why do you ask?
Tom:  Well, I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping. Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend?
Sara:  I'd like to, but I'm not sure if I can. Work has been really busy lately. Why don't we go on Friday instead?
Tom:  Friday's not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.
Sara:  OK, then let's try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?
Tom:  Yeah, that's fine.
Sara:  What's your number?
Tom:  233-331-8828. Let me give you my email address too. It's sara@gmail.com
Sara:  OK, I'll talk to you soon.
Tom:  OK.
