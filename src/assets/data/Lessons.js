          "What does the word @x@family@x@ mean to you? The easiest way to define family is to talk<br>about who you are related to. Usually, there is a mom and a dad and children who are<br>brothers and sisters. This would be the @x@core@x@ family. Then there is the @x@extended@x@ family<br>which would include grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews and<br>in-laws (people married to your bothers or sisters, husband or wife).<br>However, I think the word @x@family@x@ has a much deeper meaning. The word @x@family@x@ brings<br>words to my mind like: love, support, help, kindness, fun, love, trips, closeness, love,<br>forgiving, sharing, love, understanding, respect and love! You'll notice one word that is<br>repeated over and over again. LOVE. I believe if a family has real love for one another,<br>they will be able to overcome any problems they may have. Actually, they may not have<br>too many problems if they all love and respect one another. However, there are things<br>that cannot be helped; like death, sickness or accidents. It is during those hard times<br>that a family's love helps them to go through those experiences.<br>We had quite a few children in my family. There were brothers and sisters which included<br>an adopted brother and a number of foster children, too. I was also very fortunate that I<br>had both my mom and dad to live with and do things like vacations together. We had a lot<br>of fun and there were some times of tears, too. Above all, we love one another! Family is<br>a wonderful thing! I am so lucky!<br>",

That meant we<br>could work part of the time instead of going to school. It would count as a credit towards<br>our diploma.<br>The place I got a job was at a men's tailor shop. The owners were a very nice older<br>German couple. They had two other men working for them, too. One of the men had had<br>brain surgery for cancer. He had a big, long scar all around the top of his head. He told<br>me all about it. He was always happy and full of fun. I thought he was very brave!<br>The tailor shop made suits to order. One of the salesmen would measure the man, and<br>the customer would choose a fabric and style he (or his wife!) liked. The people in the<br>back of the shop would then cut and sew the suit. The suits cost a lot of money. There<br>were also suits already made that the customer could buy instead if they wished. They<br>could also rent suits or tuxedos for weddings or parties.<br>I worked at a little desk. I answered the phone, wrote letters, filed papers and did some<br>bookkeeping. It was about a mile walk from my school to work. I passed many clothing<br>shops. That wasn't good because I spent a lot of the money that I earned in those shops!<br>I worked at the tailor shop for almost a year.

Everyone<br>was waiting to see the beautiful bride walk up the aisle.<br>A hush, and intake of breath. There she was! Oh, she was so beautiful! She had a lovely,<br>long white dress with pretty lace and beads. Her hair was swept up off from her face.<br>There were curls flowing down her back. Instead of a veil, she had little flowers in her<br>hair. Her bouquet of tiny flowers was very, very pretty. Her dad looked very proud of her.<br>He looked just a little sad, too.<br>At the front of the church, the groom stood waiting. He had a beautiful tender smile on<br>his face. He took his bride's hand as her dad left her there. They smiled at each other.<br>The minister read, prayed and offered some words of advice to the lovely couple.<br>Someone sang a pretty song. The groom slipped the simple wedding band on the bride's<br>finger. She struggled a little to put a band on his finger. Pretty soon the minister said they<br>were now husband and wife. They kissed. We all stood, and they walked down the aisle<br>to live the rest of their lives together as Mr. And Mrs.!<br>We cried.<br>",

The tree's branches<br>sweep the earth floor.<br>You can hear the sound of a waterfall. It is roaring with life, and the water races. A bird<br>calls in the distance and as you listen, the sound gets closer. A flapping quite near makes<br>me turn and look. A great, magnificent eagle flies over my head. The strength I see in his<br>powerful wings amazes me!<br>I am never thirsty or hungry. I live off the beauty that surrounds me in this perfect place.<br>I walk on trails that lead me to breath-taking places. The beach is my favourite spot to<br>end up. The sand between my toes is soft and cool. I love to lie down on the sand. I<br>watch the sun go down. Sometimes the sun is a brilliant orange. The world seems like it<br>is on fire! Waves lull me to sleep. The seagulls wake me up.<br>In this perfect place I have learned so much. The animals and their homes are so<br>precious. I have learned to respect the animals; they were here first.<br>The sounds, smells, and sights are too perfect and full of life. There is no war here, no<br>anger or stress. I don't have to worry about pollution or destruction.<br>My perfect world exists only in my head. Maybe if we all work hard, my fantasy can<br>become real!<br>",

But whenever we went to the zoo, I always had a fun and<br>interesting time.<br>Some of the animals were very large. Of course, the elephants were huge, and they had<br>such an unusual appearance, with their big ears and their long trunk and tusks. The<br>giraffes were very tall, with long necks that reached high into the trees.<br>Some of my favorite animals were the big cats. The lions looked very powerful, with their<br>big teeth and paws. The tigers were just as big and strong, with yellow and black stripes.<br>But the bears were even larger than these cats. The polar bears, with their bright white<br>fur, liked to swim through the water. The grizzly bears had brown fur and liked to roam<br>around on land.<br>The animals from Australia seemed very unusual. The kangaroos, with their strong legs<br>and long tail, could jump great distances across the ground. The baby kangaroo could go<br>inside its mother's pouch. Another Australian animal, the koala bear, crawled slowly in<br>the trees, where it ate leaves.<br>The monkeys and apes were also very interesting. In many ways, they reminded me of<br>people. Some of the monkeys were very small. They could use their arms, legs, and tail<br>to swing through the trees. Some of the apes were very large. The gorilla was the largest<br>of all. Sometimes a big gorilla would stand up and pound his fists on his chest.<br>To see all the animals at the zoo took almost a whole day. By the end of the day, I was<br>very tired from walking around. But I was also very happy to see all the amazing animals<br>from places around the world.<br>",

Some people like to swim vigorously. Other people<br>like to relax in the water on an inflatable, floating mattress. Other people just wade<br>around in the water, as a way to keep cool.

She told her mom that classes weren't all<br>that scary; the students and the teachers weren't scary either! Natalie knew that the<br>school work would be hard, but she felt good about the people she had met that day. She<br>knew she'd have a good year.<br>",

This<br>year it is 2001, and on December 31 at midnight it will change to 2002. I wonder who<br>invented the changing of years and how it was made the way it is.

I don't<br>bother making @x@resolutions@x@ because I never do them anyway! And the ones that I do<br>make are usually ones that will happen anyway. I guess it's just common sense.<br>The biggest reason why I like New Year's is because of the fireworks that we have here in<br>Canada and many other countries, too. You should see some of the fireworks that go off.<br>There are many different colours. There's pink, blue, purple, yellow, green, red, even<br>white, silver and gold. Fireworks make loud bangs, squeals, siren sounds, and<br>sometimes all at once. There are lots of different sounds, but I can't even explain what<br>they are all like.<br>Fireworks are best when it's very dark outside. They light up the whole sky! Sometimes,<br>they look as though they are going to fall on you.<br>I like New Year's because it's fun in other ways, but the fireworks are the best part. You<br>can buy fireworks to use for your own fireworks show. However, you have to be careful<br>that no one gets burned or hurt.<br>Usually, there are parties at New Year's. Some people really dress up fancy and even<br>wear masks. They don't know who one another is until midnight when they take their<br>masks off. As midnight comes very close, everybody begins to count down, and then<br>everyone yells out @x@Happy New Year's@x@ and bang pots and pans or ring bells or honk<br>horns. Join me in the count down on New Year's Eve. @x@Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,<br>four, three, two, one - HAPPY NEW YEAR!@x@<br>",

Everyone loved music, and we had a lot of fun. I<br>started to take private singing lessons while I was in high school, too. I also sang in the<br>choir, played in a band and acted in plays in high school. The plays were all musicals, so<br>I got to sing and dance and enjoy music that way also. It was so much fun pretending to<br>be other people!<br>When I finished high school, I went to university to learn how to be a music teacher. That<br>was a lot of fun because every day I was with other people who loved music as much as I<br>do. Mostly I played the piano, but I also learned how to play the drums, a saxophone, a<br>trombone, a French horn, a clarinet, a flute, which I REALLY was not very good at, and a<br>viola. I took more singing lessons, too. We did not have plays to sing and act in, but I<br>sang in the university choir. Some years, I played the piano for other students who were<br>learning other instruments. One year, I played duets with another girl who was also there<br>to play piano. She and I made sure we played fast, funny songs, so we really enjoyed<br>ourselves doing it.<br>Now, I am a music teacher. I do not have a lot of students, not as many as I used to have<br>anyway. I still find it very rewarding. I like to see people who start off not knowing very<br>much, if anything, and go on to be very good at creating music.<br>I still love listening to music also.

Perhaps there was love, but now there is conflict.<br>These problems are hard to solve. There is no single answer. Many people have opinions<br>on what is the best answer.<br>But in mathematics there is an answer: a single answer that is right. There is no doubt;<br>there is no argument; this answer is right. If we ask, @x@What is five plus seven?@x@ The<br>answer is twelve. If we ask, @x@How do you raise a child?@x@ The answer would depend on the<br>child and the parents.<br>Sometimes there is more than one way to reach an answer. Imagine we want to find the<br>area of a triangle. The triangle has a right angle; the two sides surrounding the right<br>angle are 20mm and 30mm. The formula for the area of a triangle is one half of<br>(base)(height). We could consider the 20mm side as the base and 30 mm as the height.<br>We could consider the 30mm side as the base and the 20mm side as the height. Both<br>ways would produce the same answer. The area is 300 square mm. Alternatively, we<br>could consider the base as the third side of the triangle and then we would have to draw<br>a height and measure it. The height would be neither 20 nor 30. But still we would end<br>with the same answer. In math, the answer does not change.<br>Another reason I like math is the way it brings order. There can be a whole set of<br>numbers or a whole set of measurements that mean nothing until mathematics organizes<br>them into a pattern. An average number can be found; graphs can be drawn; the spread<br>of the numbers and probabilities of a certain number happening can be calculated. This<br>is like having a whole lot of dirty dishes after supper. Applying math is like washing and<br>sorting the dishes and putting them back into the cupboard.<br>Math is a powerful tool. Math should be our friend, and we will find more ways to use it to<br>better our lives.<br>",

There are people from all over the world<br>watching the water and using their cameras. Because it was April there was still ice<br>beside the water, huge chunks of ice that looked like white rocks. In the river there were<br>floating pieces of ice moving downstream.<br>The next day we went to the town where the Niagara River joins Lake Ontario. The<br>weather was warm. We walked a long way and our feet were hot, so we went down to the<br>edge of the water to put our feet in. One toe in was enough! The water was so cold it<br>made our feet ache! A piece of ice drifted beside our feet. I put one foot in for a second<br>then out, as the pain of the cold went right through me! My sister could not understand<br>how it could be so warm, but there was still ice.<br>Another day we went to see my daughter; she is living on a farm an hour's drive away.<br>We walked through her trees; the buds were starting to turn into leaves. We stopped and<br>looked at the spring wildflowers. We climbed across a creek by walking over a fallen tree.<br>We saw the footprints of raccoons by the water. There was fresh air and sunshine and<br>blue sky.<br>On the way home we stopped for hamburgers and fries at a drive-through restaurant. She<br>had never been to a drive-through restaurant before. Then we went to a donut shop.<br>There are no donut shops where she lives. There was a choice of 20 different types of<br>donut: some round, some with holes, some with frosting, some with jam inside--each<br>was different.<br>The days passed quickly, and soon it was time to take her back to the airport.

This beach is<br>beside a lake, and across the lake about 50 km away the large city can sometimes be<br>seen. Today the wind blew cooler air across the lake over the people on the beach. There<br>were children playing in the water. One man helped his son dig holes in the sand, and the<br>water ran into the holes. One lady held her children's hands and walked down into the<br>water. Families climbed over the rocks and sat on the last rock where the water was deep.<br>Teenagers rode bicycles and roller blades along the path beside the beach. Adults<br>walked and ran along this path, carrying water bottles around their waists<br>We sat on the blanket and ate sandwiches of meat and lettuce and strawberries from the<br>pail. We talked and read books and lay in the sun, relaxing. We wore sunscreen, but our<br>skin was getting hot. How cold was the water? We walked across the sand that almost<br>burned our feet, to the edge of the water. She went right in and lay down floating. I put<br>my toes in and felt the chill through my body. I went up to my knees, then my thighs, but<br>that was far enough! My whole body was cooled down; I headed back to the blanket to<br>lay in the sun again.<br>Soon it was time to go home, she was coming to my house for supper. We drove down<br>the highway with the windows open and our hair blowing in the warm breeze. We cut the<br>strawberries up and made a strawberry dessert with cake and ice cream. We sat outside<br>in the backyard under the maple trees with the birds singing around us and ate our<br>supper. It was a perfect ending to a relaxing summer day.<br>",

They live by the ocean, and we<br>could hear the sound of the waves through the bedroom window and see the blue water<br>of the English channel. There is an island with a castle on top in the bay. We walked<br>many times on the beach and picked up pebbles and feathers. We visited the island and<br>walked up the steep hill to the castle.<br>My mother likes to cook. She makes delicious cakes and pies. We went for a hike and<br>picked wild blackberries. She made them into a pie that smelled so good coming out of<br>the oven and tasted so good on our plates. She has many cook books with recipes from<br>all over the world and likes to try new things. She can make pastry very easily and rolls it<br>with a rolling pin quickly. When I tried to make pastry, it sticks to the rolling pin, it has<br>holes at the bottom of the pie, and it tastes like a rock! Her pastry is crisp and tender.<br>My father likes to garden. He grows lettuce, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers and<br>many flowers. When my mother was very ill last year, she had to stay in bed. He planted<br>roses outside her bedroom window, so she could open the curtains and see them. Their<br>house has small room with windows all around, and they plant seeds there in winter in<br>small pots. The warmth from the sun makes the seeds grow, and in spring they are a<br>good size to be planted outside.<br>In the house beside them and in the house in front of them, there are older ladies whose<br>husbands have died. These ladies do not drive, so my father takes my mother and the<br>two ladies to the town for shopping every week. He helps one find her groceries because<br>she cannot see well. He helps her take tapes of books from the library so she can listen<br>to books instead of reading them because of her eyes. He helps them cut their grass and<br>fix anything that is broken in the house.<br>I am very proud of my parents; they are over eighty years old and often hurt when they<br>move around. But still they help other people, and they help each other. They have been<br>married for over fifty years, but still my father loves my mother enough to plant roses for<br>her to cheer her up when she was ill.<br>",

But there are many<br>other planets that also travel around the sun. Together with the sun, the planets, and<br>various other bodies, the Earth is part of our @x@solar system.@x@<br>The planet that is closest to the sun is Mercury. Mercury is extremely hot, and it is much<br>smaller than the Earth. The second planet from the sun is Venus. Venus is about the<br>same size as the Earth. Venus is also very hot.<br>The Earth is the third planet from the sun. The Earth is unusual among the planets,<br>because it has such a large moon. The Earth is bigger than the moon, but the moon is<br>still quite large. It takes about one month for the moon to travel around the Earth.<br>The fourth planet from the sun is Mars. Mars is known for its red colour. Mars is smaller<br>and colder than the Earth. Mars has two very small moons. After the planet Mars, there<br>are many small bodies called the asteroids. These rocky objects are much smaller than<br>planets.<br>The first four planets are all made of rock and metal. The remaining planets, however, are<br>mostly made of frozen gases.<br>The fifth planet is called Jupiter. Jupiter is the largest planet. It has many moons that<br>travel around it, and it also has a large red spot. The sixth planet is called Saturn. Saturn<br>is the second-largest planet, and it is famous for the wide @x@rings@x@ that surround it. These<br>rings are made up of many smaller objects that are found in the same area.<br>The seventh planet is called Uranus. The eighth planet is called Neptune. These planets<br>are also gas giants, but they are smaller than Jupiter and Saturn. Both Uranus and<br>Neptune are so far from the sun that scientists only discovered these planets during the<br>past few hundred years, using telescopes. The other planets had all been visible to<br>curious people for many thousands of years.<br>The ninth planet is called Pluto. Pluto is very small, and it is much more rocky than the<br>gas giants. Some scientists believe that Pluto is not really a planet at all. They suggest<br>that Pluto is the largest of many asteroids that are found at the edge of the solar system.<br>The solar system is a vast place. So far, people have not travelled beyond the moon. But<br>perhaps someday, human astronauts will visit the other planets of our solar system!<br>",

A<br>beginning driver should already understand the many signs that are found along the<br>roads. Also, the student driver should know the many rules about changing lanes,<br>turning, stopping, and many other aspects of driving. In addition, the driver should be<br>familiar with the way the car is operated; it is important to know how to use the lights,<br>signals, brakes, accelerator, and steering wheel.<br>When a person starts learning to drive, it may take some time to become skilful. It takes<br>some practice to become an expert in driving a car. One must become familiar with<br>steering, speeding up, and slowing down. At first, it is good to practice driving in a large<br>open space, such as an empty parking lot. Here, one can practice without being a danger<br>to anyone.<br>When a person gains some skill in driving, it is then safe enough to practice driving on a<br>road. Of course, a student driver must still be very careful. He or she should always have<br>an expert driver in the car with him or her. Many beginning drivers take driving lessons<br>from professional instructors, who can teach safe driving techniques.<br>Eventually, the young driver is ready for a driving test, which is needed to obtain a<br>regular driver's licence. This test is supervised by a government official. In the driving<br>test, the driver must show that he or she can control the car with great skill by being able<br>to make turns and to park the car in small spaces. But he or she must also show respect<br>for the rules of the road by driving at a proper speed, and obeying all traffic signs and<br>signals.<br>Of course, even when one has obtained a driver's licence, it is always important to drive<br>carefully and responsibly!<br>",

During the winter months, huge numbers of snowflakes<br>fall to the ground, covering the land in a white blanket of snow.<br>In many parts of the world, people never see any snow. Snow only falls when there is<br>moisture in the air, and when the temperature falls below the freezing point of water,<br>which is zero degrees Celsius. During the winter, snow falls instead of rain.<br>One advantage of snow is that it allows many fun outdoor activities. Children like to play<br>in the snow. For example, they may make a @x@snowman@x@ by rolling snow into a large ball,<br>and then placing these balls of snow on top of each other, in the shape of a person.<br>Another fun activity in the snow is skiing. Skis are very long, thin, flat pieces of hard<br>material that one wears on one's feet. Wearing skis allows a person to slide along the<br>surface of the snow. People can ski down the side of a hill, travelling at great speeds.<br>Many people find the sport of downhill skiing to be very exciting. Some people like to ski<br>along flat ground, often travelling great distances. This sport, called cross-country skiing,<br>is an excellent way to develop physical fitness.<br>Of course, snow also causes some problems. Snow can make driving dangerous<br>because falling snow makes roads slippery, and on a windy day, blowing snow can make<br>it difficult to see very far. It can also be a lot of work to remove snow from the roads and<br>sidewalks. Snow is a heavy substance, and it must be cleared away using a shovel or a<br>large machine.<br>Many people love the beauty of the land when it is covered by snow. The white covering<br>of snow over the fields and trees can give a feeling of peace and calm.

For example, they recall the<br>three wise men who visited Jesus Christ shortly after his birth.

When children go to bed<br>on the evening before Christmas, they hang large socks (called stockings) in their house.<br>When they wake up on Christmas morning, the stockings have been filled with toys and<br>candy.<br>According to tradition, the presents have been given by a fat man who wears a white<br>beard and a red suit.

In the weeks before Christmas, children are usually very well behaved. Their<br>parents tell them that Santa Claus will only give presents to children who are good!<br>Another Christmas tradition is the Christmas tree. People put a small tree inside their<br>house and decorate it with various pretty objects. Nowadays, most people use an<br>artificial tree instead of a real tree. The tradition of the Christmas tree is actually older<br>than Christmas itself-the people of Europe celebrated the beginning of the winter season<br>in this way even before Christianity reached Europe.<br>Christmas is certainly one of the most important and most enjoyed holidays in Western<br>countries.<br>",

It was first celebrated<br>when English settlers arrived in the eastern part of what is now the United States, during<br>the seventeenth century. When they survived the first hard year, they celebrated and<br>gave thanks to God.

Each fall, during the time of the autumn harvest, people celebrated<br>Thanksgiving. They gave thanks for the food of the harvest, and for all the good things in<br>their lives.<br>Today, the tradition of Thanksgiving celebration continues. Families gather to eat a large<br>bird called a turkey. They also eat pumpkin pie. This is a sweet dessert that is made from<br>a large orange vegetable that grows on the ground.<br>In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. But<br>the following day, Friday, is also a holiday, and then comes the weekend. In Canada,<br>Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October. The reason for the earlier<br>celebration in Canada is that the weather is colder than in the United States. This means<br>that the harvest happens earlier in Canada, so Thanksgiving is held at an earlier date. But<br>in both countries, Thanksgiving is a very pleasant time of year.<br>",

          "Many people enjoy the experience of going out to eat at a restaurant. It is enjoyable to eat<br>one's favourite foods, or to try some entirely new food. Going out to a restaurant is also<br>fun because it allows a change from the usual routine of eating at home.<br>There are many different kinds of restaurants. One popular type of restaurant is the fast-<br>food restaurant. When ordering fast-food, you must first wait in line at the front of the<br>restaurant, and then order food from the counter. After paying, the food is quickly<br>delivered, and you can then take the food to a table, where you can enjoy your meal.<br>In most restaurants, you don't have to go to a counter to order your food. Instead, you<br>are taken to a table soon after entering the restaurant. There, a waiter comes to give you<br>a menu. You can choose your meal from the foods that are listed on the menu. After<br>ordering, it takes some time to prepare your food. After a while, the waiter brings your<br>meal to the table. When you are finished eating, the waiter brings the @x@bill@x@ or @x@check@x@.<br>You then pay for the meal, and leave some extra money as a @x@tip@x@ for the waiter.<br>In some other restaurants, the waiter does not bring the meal to your table. Instead, after<br>you are taken to a table, you then go to a counter called a @x@buffet.@x@ There you can select<br>different types of foods, such as salads, soups, meats, breads, vegetables, and desserts.<br>After putting the food on your plate, you return to your table. After eating, you can return<br>to the buffet to get more food.<br>Other restaurants can be very fancy. They may have beautiful decorations, and they may<br>have food that is prepared by expert chefs. These restaurants may also serve fine wines<br>with the food. Of course, these restaurants are very expensive. At these restaurants, it is<br>often necessary to reserve a table by telephoning the restaurant in advance.<br>Different restaurants specialize in different kinds of food. Fast-food restaurants may<br>specialize in hamburgers or chicken. Some restaurants specialize in steak or seafood.<br>Other restaurants specialize in foods that belong to a certain nationality. For example,<br>many restaurants specialize in Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, or Thai food.<br>Eating out at a restaurant can be a fun and tasty experience. What is your favourite kind<br>of restaurant?<br>",

          "When I drive in my car, I like to turn on the radio. By listening to the radio, I can enjoy<br>music and learn the latest news while I am travelling from one place to another. Of<br>course, you can also listen the radio at home, or even at work. Listening to the radio is a<br>popular activity for many people, and each city has many different radio stations.<br>There are many different kinds of radio stations. Some radio stations provide news and<br>information. Other radio stations have a @x@talk@x@ format, where listeners can call the radio<br>station's experts, to discuss political affairs or to ask for personal advice.<br>Although there are many radio stations that provide news and opinions, most radio<br>stations are mainly devoted to playing music of some kind. For example, some radio<br>stations play the songs that are currently most popular, often called the @x@top 40@x@ songs.<br>Other radio stations specialize in particular types of music. There are some stations that<br>play only classical music. Other radio stations mainly play jazz music. Some very<br>popular radio stations play @x@hard rock@x@ music. Others specialize in country music. Some<br>people prefer radio stations that play rhythm-and-blues music. Still other people enjoy<br>radio stations that specialize in soft, @x@easy listening@x@ music.<br>If you have a favourite kind of music, or even if you like to listen to all kinds of music,<br>you can probably find at least one radio station that you will like.<br>In addition to news and music, some radio stations provide other kinds of entertainment.<br>Sometimes, a story from a book will be told over the radio. Occasionally, the words of a<br>theatrical play may be heard on the radio.<br>Even in the age of television and computers, the radio has remained an important source<br>of entertainment and information. People will surely listen to the radio for a long time to<br>come.<br>",

          "Every society has laws that regulate the way people behave. A good citizen should obey<br>laws. However, there is more to being a good citizen than merely obeying laws. There are<br>many other things that people can do to make their society a pleasant one for every<br>person.<br>One way to be a good citizen is to be polite in everyday activities. For example, when<br>passing through a door, a considerate person will hold the door open for a person who is<br>close behind. Holding doors open is especially important when someone is carrying a<br>heavy load.<br>Being a good citizen is very important when travelling on the roads and streets.<br>Pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers should all follow the rules of the road. Bicyclists<br>should yield to pedestrians, and car drivers should yield to both bicyclists and<br>pedestrians. Drivers should also allow other drivers to merge into their lanes. Also,<br>drivers should avoid honking their horns except when this is necessary.<br>A good citizen will also avoid doing things that interfere with others. For example, a<br>considerate person does not smoke cigarettes in areas where this might irritate others.<br>Also, a polite person avoids playing music so loudly that other people will be annoyed.<br>And of course, a good citizen avoids littering or making a mess.<br>Other ways of being a good citizen involve greater effort. Some people serve their<br>community by doing volunteer work of some kind. Other people help by donating money<br>to a charity. Another way to serve the community is to donate blood. Blood donors are<br>needed so that there will be enough blood available to help people who are sick or<br>injured.<br>Being a good citizen is very helpful for the community, and it also gives a feeling of<br>satisfaction and pride!<br>",

          "When people feel sick, they go to a doctor. But sometimes people visit the doctor even<br>when they are not sick. Doctors can perform a medical @x@check-up@x@, to find out if a person<br>is healthy. By performing this physical examination, the doctor can identify any health<br>problems that might be developing.<br>During a check-up, the doctor examines your eyes, ears, and throat. The doctor uses a<br>small flashlight to examine the eyes, ears, and throat. It is important to make sure that<br>the eyes react normally to changes in light. It is also important to make sure that the ears<br>and throat have a normal appearance. When the doctor examines your throat, he or she<br>will ask you open your mouth wide and say @x@ah@x@.<br>The doctor uses a stethoscope to examine the patient's heartbeat. The stethoscope<br>hangs around the doctor's neck. By using a stethoscope, a doctor can hear the patient's<br>heartbeat very clearly. While checking the patient's heart, the doctor also listens carefully<br>to make sure that the patient's breathing is normal.<br>The doctor also checks the patient's blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured by<br>placing a cuff around the arm. Air is then pumped into the cuff, and this allows blood<br>pressure to be measured. Having very high blood pressure, or very low blood pressure,<br>is not good for one's health; it is better to be @x@in between@x@.<br>Another part of the examination is a test of the reflexes. The doctor tests the patient's<br>reflexes by gently hitting his of her knee with a small hammer. If a person has normal<br>reflexes, the leg will extend suddenly.<br>Sometimes a doctor may give injections using a needle, as an extra part of the check-up.<br>These injections, called vaccinations, prevent the patient from developing certain<br>illnesses.<br>Medical check-ups can help to maintain health, but people should also maintain their<br>health by leading a healthy lifestyle.<br>",

My village<br>was surrounded by many farms and many lakes.<br>The house where my family lived was near the middle of the town. On the street where<br>we lived, most of the houses were similar in size, but many of them had different shapes<br>and different colors. Each house was surrounded by a yard, where people grew their<br>lawn and their garden.<br>Often, I would walk from my house to the downtown part of the village. @x@Downtown@x@ is<br>the area where the stores and shops of a town are located. Because I lived in a small<br>town, it was a short walk to the downtown area. Along the main street, there were several<br>different kinds of stores. Some stores sold food, some stores sold clothing, and some<br>stores sold hardware (or building supplies).<br>It was also a short walk to the schools in my town. When I went to elementary school, it<br>would take about ten minutes to walk to the school. Some of my friends lived on the<br>same street where I lived. Sometimes, we walked to school together.<br>During the summer months, many people came from the big city to visit our village. The<br>people liked to get away from the busy streets of the city. They enjoyed the quietness<br>and the slow pace of village life. They also liked to spend their vacations near the lakes<br>that were near the village. People from the city often said that people who live in villages<br>seemed very friendly.<br>When I grew up, I left my village, and I went to work in a larger town. But sometimes I like<br>to go back and visit the place where I grew up.<br>",

The use of<br>the computer has changed people's lifestyles in several ways.<br>Before 1980, hardly anyone owned a computer. Only governments and large companies<br>had computers. But throughout the 1980s and 1990s, computers became much cheaper,<br>faster, and smaller, and they held much more memory. More and more people were able<br>to afford to buy a computer. By the year 2000, computers had become very common.<br>For many people, the personal computer is used mainly for performing calculations and<br>for word processing. For example, people can calculate their finances on the computer.<br>They can also use the computer to type their written documents, such as essays or<br>letters.<br>Many people enjoy playing games on their computers. Some people like to play chess or<br>checkers on their computer. Other people prefer games that require fast reflexes and fine<br>co-ordination. Computer games were very simple during the early days of the 1980s.<br>Today's computer games show detailed images and sounds.<br>Another very popular use of computers involves communication. Many people keep in<br>touch with their friends and relatives by using electronic mail, or e-mail. E-mail allows<br>people to send letters instantly to people far away. It is even possible to attach pictures<br>to one's e-mail messages.<br>Many people also like to use their computer to gain information on the Internet. The<br>Internet is a vast network of electronic pages where people can find information on many<br>different topics. For example, people can read newspapers and magazines on the<br>Internet.<br>Personal computers have only existed for a short time. But for many people, those<br>computers have quickly become a very useful part of everyday life!<br>",

And sometimes people<br>travel to visit relatives and friends.<br>There are many different ways that people can travel. Some forms of transportation move<br>people along the ground. Other methods of transportation move people across the water,<br>or through the air.<br>Airplanes provide the fastest method of travelling. Modern jet airliners travel at about<br>1000 kilometres per hour. These airplanes cruise through the skies, almost ten<br>kilometres above the level of the sea. Jet airplanes allow people to travel great distances<br>in a short time. For example, it is possible to fly across a great ocean, such as the Pacific<br>or the Atlantic, in several hours.<br>Ships were once the only way to travel across the oceans. Before airplanes, it took many<br>weeks or months to travel around the world. Today, many people still travel by ship when<br>crossing smaller bodies of water. Some ships, called ferries, allow people to bring their<br>cars with them onto the ship. Some people also like to travel by ship as part of a holiday.<br>These holiday ships, called cruise ships, stop in several interesting ports along the<br>voyage.<br>Trains are very popular in many places. In some places, such as Japan and France, trains<br>travel at high speeds of about 300 kilometres per hour. These trains move people<br>throughout the country very quickly and efficiently. Trains are also used to move people<br>over short distances, such as the trip from one's home to one's workplace.<br>Buses and cars are also widely used for transportation. Some people travel by bus or car<br>for only short trips, but sometimes buses and cars are used for very long journeys. In<br>North America, many people have driven across Canada or the United States in their cars.<br>The wide, smooth roads allow cars and buses to travel quickly from one place to another.<br>There are many different methods of transportation.

They even<br>flew over top of their house! They took pictures of their house. They could see their pond<br>from way up there, too.<br>The pilot asked Tasha if she wanted to fly the plane. @x@Sure!@x@ Tasha said. So, Tasha took<br>the steering handle and began to fly the plane.

        Title: "Louis Pasteur",
        Content:
          "Louis Pasteur was one of the greatest scientists of all time. Pasteur made very important discoveries in biology and chemistry, and the techniques he developed helped greatly to develop medical science and the agricultural and food industries.<br>Pasteur was born in a small town in France during the year 1822. When he was a young<br>man, Pasteur studied science at a university in the city of Paris. He soon did some<br>excellent work in chemistry, and later began his famous study of germs.<br>Pasteur was one of the first scientists to understand that many diseases could be caused<br>by extremely small, invisible organisms. Only a few other scientists had believed this<br>before Pasteur. He advised doctors to wash their hands thoroughly before treating<br>patients.<br>Pasteur also demonstrated that life forms did not arise spontaneously. His research<br>confirmed the idea, developed by previous scientists, that a living organism would not<br>appear unless other individuals of its kind were present.<br>One of Pasteur's most important contributions was a technique that has been named<br>after him: pasteurization. Pasteurization kills the germs that are found in drinks such as<br>milk or beer. Because of Pasteur's technique, people are no longer infected with<br>diseases by drinking these liquids.<br>Just as important as pasteurization was a technique called immunization. Pasteur found<br>that a person or animal could be made safe, or immune, from a disease, by injecting the<br>person with some weakened germs that cause the disease. The body can resist the<br>disease after being immunized in this way. Today, many diseases are prevented by the<br>use of this technique.<br>Pasteur's discoveries also helped to save people who had already been infected with<br>diseases. One such disease is rabies. Rabies is a disease that sometimes occurs in<br>animals. This disease usually kills the animal, but before dying, the animal becomes very<br>aggressive, and may spread the disease by biting a person or another animal.<br>One day, the parents of a young boy came to Pasteur. Their son had been bitten by a dog<br>that had the rabies disease. The parents knew that their son would die from the disease,<br>unless something could be done to save him. Pasteur agreed to help the boy, and the<br>immunization technique saved the boy's life.<br>Pasteur died in 1895. He was greatly admired around the world for his achievements,<br>which have helped all of humankind. Today, Pasteur is considered to be the greatest<br>figure in the history of medicine.<br>",

        Content:
          "Are you interested in the behaviour of people and animals? If you are, then you might<br>enjoy the study of psychology. Psychology is the study of behaviour, but this is a very<br>large area of study. There are several different branches of psychology, each of which<br>studies a different aspect of behaviour.<br>Social psychologists study interactions among people. For example, a social<br>psychologist might try to learn about the situations that cause people to behave<br>aggressively. Another question studied by social psychologists is why certain people<br>become attracted to each other. One of the interesting problems in social psychology is<br>conformity: what causes people to behave in the same way, and to follow what others do<br>and say?<br>Cognitive psychologists study thinking, memory, and language. One problem studied by<br>cognitive psychologists is how people remember numbers. For example, what is the best<br>way to memorize some numbers? Is it better to repeat the numbers to oneself, or to try to<br>attach some meaning to these numbers? A cognitive psychologist might also study<br>language. For example, why can young children learn a second language so quickly and<br>easily? Cognitive psychologists are also interested in the ways that people learn to solve<br>problems, such as finding a new place.<br>Clinical psychologists study mental illnesses. For example, a clinical psychologist might<br>try to find out the causes of depression and to figure out ways of helping people who are<br>depressed. Other clinical psychologists might study the behaviour of people who suffer<br>from addiction to drugs, so that this problem can be prevented and treated. Another topic<br>of interest to clinical psychologists is violent behaviour. It is very important to find ways<br>of preventing violence and to change the behaviour of persons who act violently.<br>Some psychologists are interested in the measurement of psychological characteristics.<br>For example, psychologists might develop tests to assess a person's intelligence,<br>personality traits, or interests. These tests can be used to help people make decisions<br>about education, occupation, and clinical treatment.<br>Psychologists who study the behaviour of animals are called ethologists. Ethologists<br>often go into wilderness areas to watch the activity of birds, fish, or other animals. These<br>psychologists try to figure out why it is that some animals have @x@instincts@x@ for various<br>behaviours such as parenting, mating, or fighting. Some ethologists have learned very<br>much about the unusual behaviours observed in many animals.<br>These are only a few of the many areas of psychology. Truly, psychology is one of the<br>most interesting areas of knowledge!<br>",

        Title: "Corruption",
        Content:
          "When an official of a government or business is acting dishonestly, we say that this<br>person is corrupt. Corruption is a serious problem in many countries around the world.<br>There are several different kinds of corrupt practices, including bribes, kickbacks,<br>nepotism, and embezzlement.<br>A bribe is a payment of money or some other benefit, in exchange for a decision that<br>would not otherwise be made. For example, an accused criminal might bribe a judge so<br>that the judge would make a decision of @x@not guilty.@x@ Another example is that a business<br>owner might bribe a government official so that the official would allow the construction<br>of very unsafe buildings.<br>A kickback is similar to a bribe, except that the official receives some part of the money<br>in a dishonest business deal. For example, governments sometimes decide which<br>company should build a road. A company might offer money to the government official<br>who makes the decision, so that this company will be chosen, even if it is not the best<br>company for the job.<br>Nepotism happens when an official unfairly gives advantages to his or her relatives. For<br>example, a government official might hire a brother or sister to do a job even though<br>other people would be much better qualified for the job. Of course, all of us want to help<br>our relatives, but it is wrong to do this at the expense of the public.<br>Embezzlement happens when an official secretly steals some money from a company or<br>government. For example, a manager at a company might secretly move some of the<br>company's money to his or her own bank account, or that manager might lie about his or<br>her expenses in order to receive more payment from the company.<br>Corruption has very bad effects on people, in several ways. Sometimes it can lead to<br>very dangerous situations. One example of this is when unsafe construction projects are<br>approved by officials who have been bribed. Another example is when criminals are<br>freed as a result of bribes. Also, a country's economy can be damaged by corruption. For<br>example, if companies must pay bribes in order to do business, then they may decide to<br>leave the country. Also, if people's tax money is stolen by corrupt officials, this makes<br>the people poorer. In addition, when company officials are corrupt, it makes the company<br>less able to compete with other companies.<br>How can corruption be stopped? An important step is for each person to decide not to<br>act in ways that are corrupt. People must agree to take this problem seriously. Also, each<br>company and each government must have strict rules about corruption. It must be very<br>clear to all employees-from the lowest to the highest-that corruption is totally<br>unacceptable.<br>",

Canada is divided into ten<br>provinces and three territories, each of which is different from the others.<br>The province of British Columbia is located at the far western end of Canada. British<br>Columbia stretches from the Pacific Ocean, at the west, to the Rocky Mountains, at the<br>east. British Columbia contains the city of Vancouver, where two million people live. Most<br>of the land of British Columbia is very mountainous, with vast forests covering the<br>mountains. In British Columbia, forestry is an important industry, providing wood for<br>people around the world.<br>Moving east from British Columbia, the next provinces are Alberta, Saskatchewan, and<br>Manitoba. These are known as the prairie provinces, because they are mostly made of<br>flat, grassy land called @x@prairie.@x@ Alberta is the province where the flat prairie meets the<br>tall and beautiful Rocky Mountains. In Alberta, there are many fields where oil and gas<br>are found, and there are also many farms where cattle are raised. Saskatchewan is the<br>Canadian province that grows the most wheat. Wheat from Saskatchewan is sent around<br>the world to make bread and pasta for many people. Manitoba is the other prairie<br>province. Its largest city, Winnipeg, is about halfway between the Pacific and Atlantic<br>oceans. Winnipeg has the coldest winters of any large city in the world, with<br>temperatures sometimes reaching -40 degrees Celsius!<br>Moving east, the next province is Ontario. The land in the northern part of Ontario is very<br>rocky and contains many thousands and thousands of lakes. Many mines are found in<br>northern Ontario. In the southern part of Ontario, there is good farmland, and there are<br>also many cities where factories produce cars and steel. Ontario contains Canada's<br>largest city, Toronto, as well as the capital city of Canada--Ottawa. In the southern part of<br>Ontario are four of the largest lakes in the world, known as the Great Lakes.<br>Next to Ontario is the province of Quebec. Unlike the other provinces, where most people<br>speak English, most of the people in Quebec speak French. The capital of Quebec is<br>called Quebec City, and this is one of the oldest cities in North America. Quebec City<br>contains many buildings that are hundreds of years old. Also in the province of Quebec<br>is the city of Montreal. Of all the French-speaking cities in the world, only Paris is larger<br>than Montreal!<br>In the eastern part of Canada are the Atlantic provinces, which are next to the Atlantic<br>Ocean. These provinces are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and<br>Newfoundland. In the Atlantic provinces, fishing is an important industry. Tourism is also<br>important as many people come to see the beauty of these provinces. The people in<br>these provinces are said to be the friendliest in Canada.<br>In the far north of Canada are the three territories that lie beside the Arctic Ocean: Yukon,<br>Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. Many of the people in these territories are the Native<br>people of Canada, known as the Indians and the Inuit. The northern areas have very cold,<br>dark winters. The summer is short, but the days are very long and bright.<br>",

        Content:
          "Many people admire the paintings and sculptures that artists create. Some very beautiful<br>paintings and sculptures were created by two men who lived in the same country at the<br>same time. These men were Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. They both lived in Italy<br>around the year 1500.<br>Leonardo da Vinci is most famous for his painting called the Mona Lisa. This is perhaps<br>the best-known painting in the world. The Mona Lisa shows the head and shoulders of a<br>dark-haired woman. When people look at this painting, they are often captivated by her<br>smile and by her eyes, which have a look of mystery.<br>Another painting of Leonardo's is called The Last Supper. This painting shows a famous<br>scene from the Christian religion. In this painting, Jesus Christ is seated at the middle of<br>a long table, with his followers (the disciples) seated around him. Many of the paintings<br>that were created at this time have a religious theme.<br>Leonardo was not only an artist; he was also interested in engineering. He actually<br>worked for some time as an advisor to a military leader, helping him to develop new<br>machines for use in war. Leonardo also made rough drawings of machines that are<br>similar to those that were invented much later, such as submarines and helicopters.<br>Obviously, Leonardo was an extremely creative man.<br>Michelangelo was about 23 years younger than Leonardo. In addition to being a painter,<br>Michelangelo was also a sculptor, and many experts consider him the greatest sculptor<br>of all time. One of his most famous sculptures is David, which is a statue of a young man<br>who was a famous figure in the Bible. Another great sculpture of Michelangelo's is called<br>the Pieta. The Pieta shows Mary, the mother of Jesus, holding the body of her son across<br>her lap.<br>Michelangelo is also famous for painting the ceiling of a church known as the Sistine<br>Chapel. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Julius, asked Michelangelo to<br>paint the ceiling of this new church. This project required many years of hard work, and<br>the Pope complained that it took too long. However, when the work was finished, the<br>ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was covered with beautiful paintings of many scenes from<br>the Bible.<br>Fortunately, many of the works of Leonardo and of Michelangelo can still be seen today<br>in the art galleries of Europe. During the past 500 years, the color of the paintings had<br>faded somewhat, but in recent years, some work has been done to restore the paintings<br>to their original appearance.<br>",

          "About a thousand years ago, people known as the Vikings were known and feared<br>throughout Europe. The Vikings were the people of the northern part of Europe, called<br>Scandinavia, which includes the modern countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.<br>The Vikings made their living by farming and fishing. However, by about the year 700,<br>they began making attacks, or raids, upon towns along the coasts of Europe in order to<br>steal the wealth of those towns.<br>The Vikings made their attacks very quickly and without any warning. They were very<br>cruel to the people of the towns they attacked, and they sometimes destroyed the towns<br>by burning down the buildings. In some parts of Europe, the local kings would often fight<br>against the Vikings. Sometimes, however, the kings would pay the Vikings in order to<br>persuade them not to attack.<br>Although the Vikings were known as fierce warriors, they also built excellent ships. The<br>wooden Viking ships, called longboats, were able to sail even in very bad weather. Many<br>Viking longboats were about 20 metres long, but some were nearly 90 metres long. The<br>Viking sailors used both sails and oars to move their ships.<br>The Vikings travelled across a large area. They made many of their attacks in Britain,<br>France, and Germany, but sometimes sailed south, into the Mediterranean Sea. Other<br>Vikings moved to the east, and then south along the rivers of Russia. Some even went as<br>far as the area that is now the country of Turkey. In some places, the Vikings decided to<br>stay. Many Vikings settled in England and in France, and eventually they mixed with the<br>local people. Other Vikings settled in Russia and also mixed with the people there.<br>The most famous travels of the Vikings were in the Atlantic Ocean. Vikings sailed<br>westward to the island of Iceland where many of them stayed. Today, the people of<br>Iceland are descended from the Vikings. Some Vikings sailed farther west to the cold<br>island of Greenland. Vikings lived in Greenland for several generations, but eventually<br>they died out. Some Vikings had gone even further west and reached the Canadian island<br>of Newfoundland. The Vikings only stayed for a few years, but they had reached North<br>America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus!<br>Gradually, the Vikings became converted to the Christian religion. They also stopped<br>raiding the towns of Europe, and instead of fighting, they began trading with their<br>neighbors. Today, the Scandinavian countries are known as very peace-loving nations.<br>",

          "There have been many great writers in the history of English literature, but there is no<br>doubt about which writer was the greatest. Many people consider William Shakespeare to<br>have been the best writer who ever lived.<br>William Shakespeare was born in the town of Stratford, England, in the year 1564. When<br>he was a young man, Shakespeare moved to the city of London, where he began writing<br>plays. His plays were soon very successful, and were enjoyed both by the common<br>people of London and also by the rich and famous. In addition to his plays, Shakespeare<br>wrote many short poems and a few longer poems. Like his plays, these poems are still<br>famous today.<br>Shakespeare's most famous plays include Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear,<br>Othello, and Julius Caesar. Usually, Shakespeare did not invent the stories that he told in<br>his plays. Instead, he wrote his plays using stories that already existed. However,<br>Shakespeare's plays told these stories in a more interesting way than ever before. Some<br>of the stories were tragedies, some were comedies, and some described historical<br>events.<br>In his plays, Shakespeare revealed a very wide knowledge of many areas of life. The<br>characters in his plays discuss many different topics, often with the knowledge of<br>experts. But what is even more impressive about these plays is Shakespeare's use of the<br>English language. His vocabulary was very large, and Shakespeare seems to have<br>introduced many words to the language! Also, many of the phrases that are said by<br>Shakespeare's characters are now used in everyday conversation. Today, writers often<br>use quotations from Shakespeare's plays in their own works.<br>But perhaps even the most impressive features of Shakespeare's plays are the<br>characters within them. The many characters in his plays seem very different from each<br>other, but they seem very realistic. The emotions they feel, the words they say, and the<br>actions they perform are all easily understood. Many people who watch one of<br>Shakespeare's plays will find that they know people who remind them somewhat of the<br>characters in those plays.<br>Shakespeare died in the year 1619, but his writings are still popular today, 400 years after<br>they were written. The poems and plays are greatly admired by experts in literature, but<br>also by people in general. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people enjoy attending<br>performances of Shakespeare's plays. No other writer in the English language has<br>remained so popular for such a long time.<br>",

          "One of the most popular sports in northern countries is the game of ice hockey. Each<br>winter, this sport is played by hundreds of thousands of children and adults in North<br>America and in Europe. Ice hockey is a fast and exciting game that can make winter<br>much more enjoyable.<br>The game of ice hockey is played on a flat surface of ice called a rink. The rink is about<br>60 metres long, and about 25 or 30 metres wide. At any time, each team has six players<br>on the ice. On their feet the players wear skates, whose thin metal blades allow fast<br>movement along the ice surface. Learning to skate requires time and practice, but many<br>people can skate very quickly and smoothly.<br>In many ways, ice hockey is similar to soccer. However, unlike soccer, there is no large<br>ball used in hockey. Instead, the players use a hard, black, rubber disk, which is called a<br>puck. The players skate around the ice, trying to get the puck. They do not use their<br>hands or their feet to control the puck. Instead, they carry long wooden sticks, which are<br>shaped in such a way that it is easy to push the puck along the ice. The players can pass<br>the puck to each other by sliding it across the ice.<br>To score a goal, a hockey player must shoot the puck into the net of the opposing team,<br>but this is a difficult task. The net is less than two metres wide, and it is protected by a<br>player called the goaltender. However, some players can shoot the puck very suddenly<br>and with great power.<br>Sometimes, the sport of ice hockey can be quite rough. Players try to take the puck from<br>their opponents by bumping into them at a high speed. This is called a @x@body check.@x@<br>Players are not allowed to hit each other with their sticks. If a player does this, then that<br>player may be given a penalty by the referee, who enforces the rules of the game.<br>Naturally, the sport of ice hockey is most popular in countries that have cold winters. The<br>sport was first played in Canada, but it is also very popular in many countries of Europe,<br>including Russia, Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Germany. In<br>addition, many people play hockey in the United States.<br>In previous generations, ice hockey was considered a sport for men and boys only.<br>However, in recent years, women and girls have been playing hockey much more<br>frequently than in the past. Not only do many girls enjoy playing hockey for fun, but now<br>women's hockey is officially a sport at the winter Olympics.<br>",

          "In recent years, many people have moved to North America from China, but many people<br>do not know that Chinese people have a long history in Canada and the United States.<br>During the nineteenth century, both Canada and the United States were rapidly<br>expanding to the west, toward the Pacific Ocean. In those days, there were of course no<br>cars or airplanes to allow people and goods to move across the land. Instead, the best<br>method of long-distance transportation was the railroad. Railway trains could move<br>quickly across the countryside. However, there was one problem: before the railway<br>trains could run, railroads had to be built across very long distances.<br>To build the railroads was a very big job. Many men would be needed because the<br>distance was so long and the land was so difficult, with many mountains and rivers to be<br>crossed. For the men who owned the railroad companies, it would have been too<br>expensive to hire Canadian or American men to build the railroads because those<br>workers would only work for high wages.<br>The railroad owners decided to get workers from overseas. Many Chinese men were<br>willing to work for low wages because they were very poor. These men would work very<br>hard and send much of the money back to their relatives in China.<br>Thousands of Chinese men were brought to North America to work on the railroads. They<br>did good work, but their employers treated them badly. The work day was very long, and<br>working conditions were very unsafe. Many Chinese men died in accidents while<br>constructing the railroads. Some Chinese women also came to North America, but there<br>were many more men than women.<br>After the railroads were completed, by about the year 1900, very few Chinese people<br>were allowed to come to North America. Most people in Canada and the United States<br>were not familiar with Chinese people and did not want strangers to come to their<br>countries. Any Chinese person who came to North America had to pay an expensive tax.<br>This made it difficult for Chinese men to bring their wives and families to join them in<br>North America. Later, the governments of Canada and the United States made Chinese<br>immigration illegal.<br>Eventually, the people of Canada and the United States realized that their laws had been<br>unfair. They changed the rules so that Chinese people could immigrate in the same way<br>that people from other countries could do so. In recent decades, many Chinese people<br>have moved to North America, and have formed a very lively and successful community.<br>Many cities, such as Toronto, Vancouver, San Francisco, and New York, have been<br>enriched by Chinese culture. Chinese people are now very prominent in North America,<br>just as they were many years ago.<br>",

This group also includes languages such as German and Dutch.<br>About 1500 years ago, these languages were not yet distinct from each other. Some of<br>the people of Germany and the Netherlands then moved to England. Those people were<br>called the Anglo-Saxons, and their language then evolved into English. Most of the basic<br>words of the English language are derived from these very old Anglo-Saxon languages.<br>For example, the words for the parts of the body, for numbers, and for animals are mostly<br>Anglo-Saxon words.<br>Some new words were brought to England over 1000 years ago by people who came<br>from the Scandinavian countries of northern Europe. Many words that begin with the<br>letters @x@sk@x@, such as skin and skill, are Scandinavian words.<br>A major change happened in the English language after the year 1066. In that year,<br>England was conquered by a king from the northern part of France. He and his followers<br>spoke French, so French became an important language in England. During the next few<br>hundred years, the English language absorbed a very large number of French words. In<br>fact, today's English dictionaries contain more words of French origin than of Anglo-<br>Saxon origin. Part of the reason why the English language has so many words is that it<br>often has two words for each idea-one word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and one word of<br>French origin.<br>Many more words entered the English language a few hundred years ago, when science<br>and technology became more widespread. Most scientific and technical words are<br>derived from words of the ancient languages of Latin and Greek. Because there are so<br>many of these scientific and technical words in the English language today, the influence<br>of Latin and Greek has been quite large.<br>Other languages have also contributed many words to the English language. Some<br>words have come from the Celtic languages, spoken in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.<br>Many words have been added to the English language by immigrants who came to North<br>America from various countries of Europe. Also, many more words have been adopted<br>from the Native languages of North America, Australia, and the Pacific, and from the<br>languages of peoples in Africa and Asia. All of these words have made English a very<br>interesting language!<br>",

        Title: "African Slavery in the Americas",
        Content:
          "One of the most tragic parts of the history of North and South America is the period of<br>African slavery. For hundreds of years, many people were taken from Africa, by force, to<br>work in the fields of many different countries in North and South America.<br>When Europeans first came to the Americas, some of them realized that they might make<br>money by growing crops and selling them in Europe. However, in order to make money,<br>they would need a cheap source of labor. Few Europeans would come to the Americas to<br>work for low wages, so instead, the landowners looked for slaves. In the areas of the<br>great farms, or plantations, there were few Indians, so they used another source of<br>slaves: Africa.<br>The plantation owners usually obtained slaves by buying them from local kings in<br>western Africa. This led to many wars between rival kings within Africa, who tried to<br>capture each other's people in order to sell them as slaves. A few kings tried to avoid the<br>slave trade, but this was very difficult.<br>During a period of several hundred years, from the 1500s to the 1800s, about 12 million<br>people were taken from western Africa to the Americas. Many more people died as slaves<br>before leaving Africa, and many more died on the ships that took them to the Americas.<br>This was because the conditions on the ships were extremely unhealthy: the ships were<br>far too crowded, and there was little food and water.<br>When the African slaves arrived in the Americas, the plantation owners made them work<br>on farms that produced goods such as cotton and sugar. In many places, the work was<br>very hard, and many of the slaves died from overwork. They were then replaced by other<br>slaves who arrived from Africa. However, many slaves survived despite the brutal<br>conditions. In some places, the African slaves were able to revolt against the plantation<br>owners. However, this was difficult because the slaves who had recently arrived spoke<br>many different languages. Some slaves escaped into wilderness areas and were able to<br>remain free from the plantation owners.<br>As time went by, many people in Europe and in the Americas realized that slavery was<br>wrong. By the 1830s, slavery had been ended, or abolished, in islands owned by the<br>British, and in parts of the United States. In the southern United States, slavery was<br>ended in the 1860s, during the Civil War. In some countries, such as Brazil and Cuba,<br>slavery only ended in the 1880s.<br>Today, many millions of people in North and South America are the descendants of<br>slaves who were brought from Africa. The effects of slavery have lasted for many<br>generations, and there was much racial prejudice against African people even when<br>slavery ended. However, some have achieved success despite these disadvantages.<br>Today, the people of African background in North and South America are a very<br>important part of the population in many countries.<br>",

This can sometimes lead them to do<br>things that are unhealthy.<br>For example, many women believe that they must be very thin in order to be attractive.<br>They see pictures of fashion models who are very thin and then believe that an attractive<br>woman must look the same way. However, many men prefer the appearance of women<br>who are not so thin.<br>In order to become thin, some women try to reduce the amount of food that they eat.<br>When this is taken to an extreme, a woman might eat far too little food to remain healthy.<br>Her weight may become dangerously low, as she tries to become thinner and thinner.<br>This condition is called @x@anorexia,@x@ and it affects many thousands of women in Western<br>countries.<br>Anorexia is one of several conditions known as eating disorders. Another eating disorder<br>is called @x@bulimia.@x@ A woman who has bulimia will sometimes eat large amounts of food,<br>but then will try to eliminate the food, by vomiting. This is intended to prevent any weight<br>gain, but it is also a very unhealthy behavior.<br>Unfortunately, some women are concerned about being very thin, but some women have<br>different concerns related to the appearance of their body. For example, some women<br>believe that their breasts are not large enough, and undergo surgery to enlarge their<br>breasts. In this surgery, some artificial substance is implanted inside the breast to make<br>it larger. Many women have had this surgery, but many of them have suffered serious<br>health problems as a result.<br>In recent years, many men have also become very concerned about their physical<br>appearance. For example, some men believe that they must become very muscular in<br>order to have an attractive appearance. To achieve this appearance, some men use drugs<br>called steroids, which make it possible to gain large amounts of muscle. However,<br>steroids can have very unhealthy side effects. In addition to drugs, some men have used<br>surgery to change their physical appearance. For example, some men have had implants<br>to make their arms, legs, or chest appear larger.<br>It is unfortunate that so many people feel so unhappy about their physical appearance<br>and that they do unhealthy things to change the way they look. Of course, everyone<br>should try to be healthy, but people must also learn to accept their physical appearance.<br>Many different body types can be attractive, and there is no single ideal body type.

          "In modern society, many people find that they do not get very much exercise. They travel<br>by bus, train, or car, and they can move up or down in elevators. They have machines<br>that do most of the heavy work that was once done by people. However, exercise is<br>important for staying healthy. A person who exercises frequently will be @x@physically fit.@x@<br>There are different aspects of physical fitness.<br>One important element of being physically fit is called cardio-vascular fitness. The word<br>@x@cardio-vascular@x@ refers to the heart and lungs. If one's heart and lungs are in good<br>condition, then one can exercise at a steady pace without soon getting tired. To develop<br>cardio-vascular fitness, it is important to perform some exercise that makes one's heart<br>beat quickly. For example, a person can improve cardio-vascular fitness by riding a<br>bicycle, by running, by swimming, by rowing, or even by walking quickly. Some people<br>go to special places, called @x@health clubs@x@ or @x@gyms,@x@ where they can use different<br>exercise machines to develop their cardio-vascular fitness. But many people improve<br>their cardio-vascular fitness by playing recreational sports, such as tennis or soccer, or<br>by dancing vigorously. By having good cardio-vascular fitness, one is less likely to suffer<br>from heart disease. Of course, there is one way to improve cardio-vascular fitness that<br>does not involve exercise: stop smoking!<br>Another important aspect of physical fitness is called flexibility. Flexibility refers to one's<br>ability to stretch comfortably. For example, a healthy person should be able to touch his<br>or her toes without bending the legs. People can perform various stretching exercises to<br>improve flexibility. By being flexible, a person can avoid injuries that might otherwise<br>affect their body.<br>Yet another important aspect of physical fitness is the strength and endurance of one's<br>muscles. Many people suffer from injuries that result, in part, from weakness of the<br>muscles. Muscular strength and endurance can be improved by a variety of exercises.<br>Some of these exercises involve lifting a weight, but other exercises simply involve<br>pushing or pulling against the weight of one's own body. One example is an exercise<br>called the @x@push-up.@x@ In this exercise, a person lies on the floor, with the face pointing<br>down. The person bends his or her arms, so that the palms of the hands are on the floor,<br>next to the shoulders. The person then pushes with his or her arms, lifting the upper part<br>of the body above the ground until the arms are straight.<br>Before starting to do any exercises, it is a good idea to have a medical check-up. Some<br>people do not want to exercise because they think it will be too much work. However,<br>many people find that they feel very good when they exercise. Exercising can be an<br>enjoyable and fun way to maintain health and fitness.<br>",

        Content:
          "In most English-speaking countries, a person who is accused of a crime has the right to<br>a @x@trial by jury.@x@ In a trial by jury, the guilt or innocence of the accused person is decided<br>by a group of 12 people, called jurors, who must listen to the evidence about the case.<br>The idea of trial by jury is over 800 years old, but there was a time when criminal cases<br>were decided in other ways. Today, many of these methods seem ridiculous and cruel.<br>Many accused people were forced to undergo a trial by ordeal. There were several<br>different kinds of this trial. For example, in the ordeal by fire, an accused man was forced<br>to carry a red-hot piece of iron in his hand. People believed that if the man were innocent<br>then the gods would protect him, and his hand would not be burned or blistered by the<br>iron.<br>Another form of the trial by ordeal was the ordeal by combat. If one person accused<br>another of a crime, they would be forced to fight each other with some weapon. People<br>believed that the gods would help the man who was right and allow him to win the fight.<br>Yet another kind of ordeal was the ordeal by water. If a woman was accused of a crime,<br>such as witchcraft, she might be thrown into a river with rocks attached to her. People<br>believed that the gods would help an innocent woman and allow her to float on the water.<br>Gradually, people realized that the trial by ordeal was a completely worthless way to<br>judge a person's innocence or guilt. They wanted a less barbaric way to decide criminal<br>cases. During the twelfth century, a new method was introduced by one of the kings of<br>England, Henry the Second. Henry said that criminal cases should be decided by the<br>opinions of twelve honest men who knew about the crime, the victim, and the accused<br>person. This was the beginning of trial by jury in English-speaking countries, and the<br>method soon became very popular. People trusted this new method much more than<br>they trusted the old methods.<br>Later, the system of trial by jury changed somewhat. Instead of having a jury of twelve<br>men and women who knew about the crime, juries were chosen so that the twelve people<br>did not know anything about the crime. This change ensures that the jurors do not have<br>any bias or prejudice about the case. When jurors do not know any of the people<br>involved in the case, their decisions are more likely to be fair and accurate.<br>Today, citizens in many countries are called occasionally for jury duty. This can be<br>inconvenient for people who are busy with their work and family life. However, many men<br>and women are willing to serve on juries because of a feeling of responsibility to society.<br>The use of juries in criminal cases helps to ensure that justice is done.<br>",

He was never<br>a President of the United States, but he made great achievements in many areas of life,<br>including business, literature, science, and politics.<br>Benjamin Franklin was born in the city of Boston, during the year 1706. In his early years,<br>Franklin was very poor. As a young man, he worked for his older brother, who was a<br>printer. However, the two brothers soon argued with each other. Benjamin decided to<br>leave, and he moved to the city of Philadelphia. He worked very hard and soon became a<br>successful printer. He published his own newspapers, and he also published books<br>called almanacs, which contained many wise sayings. Many of the wise sayings in<br>Franklin's almanacs are still repeated today.<br>Franklin's printing business was very successful, but he was also very interested in<br>science. He performed experiments on the topic of electricity. Some of these experiments<br>were very dangerous. In one experiment, Franklin was almost killed when he went<br>outside during a lightning storm and flew a kite that had a metal key attached. However,<br>Franklin was lucky enough to avoid injury, and he learned new facts about electricity.<br>In addition to scientific research, Franklin was also an inventor. He invented a new kind<br>of eye-glasses called @x@bifocals.@x@ Bifocals are eye-glasses that allow people to see things<br>that are far away, but also allow them to read things that are very close. Another<br>invention was a new kind of stove for burning wood. This new stove was much more<br>efficient than the older stoves had been. He also invented a lightning rod, which keeps<br>houses safe from lightning.<br>Franklin was also interested in making his city a better place to live. He started a public<br>library, and he helped to organize a hospital and a fire department. In addition, he<br>supervised the postal service, which operated profitably under his command. In his later<br>years, Franklin became heavily involved in politics. For most of Franklin's life, the United<br>States was not yet a country. Instead, the states were still colonies of England, but<br>Franklin encouraged other Americans to become an independent country. When the<br>United States became a country, Franklin became the American ambassador to France.<br>The French people liked Franklin very much. Franklin later returned to the United States,<br>and he died in 1790.<br>Today, many Americans still admire the brilliant achievements of Benjamin Franklin, who<br>did so much to improve people's lives.

        Content:
          "Many thousands of years ago, much of the world's land area was covered in forests.<br>Since that time, people have needed to clear the forests by cutting down the trees in<br>order to make room for their farms and cities. Today, forests are still being cleared, and<br>many people are worried that too much forest area is being lost.<br>There are many reasons why it is important to preserve forests. One reason is that the<br>trees inside the forests help to remove carbon dioxide from the air and put oxygen back<br>into the air. This is important, because scientists believe that too much carbon dioxide in<br>the air might be causing the world's temperature to increase quickly. The forests might<br>help to reduce this problem by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air.<br>Another reason for preserving forests is to maintain many different species of plants and<br>animals. The forests are the home of a huge variety of plants and animals, which will<br>become extinct if the forests are destroyed. These plants and animals are both beautiful<br>and interesting, but they also have practical benefits for people. For example, doctors<br>believe that many diseases might be treated by chemicals that are obtained from forest<br>plants.<br>Forests are also important for providing wood, or lumber, but sometimes people cut<br>down too many trees for lumber. To preserve the forests, it is important to ensure that the<br>amount of wood removed is not more than the amount of new wood that grows in the<br>forest. Otherwise, the forest will gradually disappear.<br>In many parts of the world, forests have already been cleared. In recent years, many<br>forests have been cleared in South America, Africa, and southeast Asia. In other parts of<br>the world, the forests had already been cleared a long time ago. There are only a few<br>areas of the world where very large areas of forests have not yet been changed by people.<br>These areas include the Amazon rain forest of Brazil, and the northern forests of Canada,<br>Alaska, and Siberia.<br>Some countries have passed laws to protect their forests from being cleared. For<br>example, a country can declare its forest areas to be a national park and prevent the<br>forests from being cut down. However, this is very difficult for poor countries to do. The<br>people may want to cut down the forests to obtain wood, to gain access to natural<br>resources in the forest areas, or to have new land for farming. When forests are cut down<br>to gain new farmland, however, people usually find that the soil is not very good for<br>farming.<br>It is a difficult challenge to provide opportunities for poor people of these countries, and<br>to protect the forests at the same time. However, it is very important that this challenge<br>be met successfully because the forests will be needed by future generations of people.<br>",

          "Nowadays, the issue of violence on television is often debated. Many people are<br>concerned that the images of violent acts might cause the viewers to become more<br>aggressive. Some of these people believe that there should be restrictions on violent<br>television programs. Other people feel that individuals should be able to choose what<br>they want to watch on TV. Many of these people believe that violent television is unlikely<br>to affect people's behaviour.<br>One of the concerns that some people have about violent TV is that viewers might imitate<br>aggressive acts. For example, consider a TV program that shows professional wrestlers.<br>Some people believe that children who watch the program might copy the actions of the<br>wrestlers and that this could lead to serious injuries. As another example, consider a TV<br>program that shows people shooting guns at each other. Some people believe that<br>viewers of such a program might be more likely to use a gun in their disputes with others.<br>Another concern that some people have with violent TV is that it might make people less<br>sensitive to the effects of violence. In other words, people who watch many acts of<br>violence on television might no longer be shocked by violent acts. They might then<br>become quite tolerant of the use of violence.<br>Some people do not believe that violence on television is likely to have harmful effects.<br>They point out that many terrible acts of violence occurred long before television. They<br>also argue that people can tell the difference between television and real life. That is,<br>they say that people are unlikely to imitate violent acts, and are unlikely to become less<br>sensitive to violence in real life. Also, they argue that parents are able to prevent their<br>children from watching violent television.<br>Psychologists have conducted some research studies on the effects of violent television.<br>Some studies have shown that children who watch a lot of violent TV do become slightly<br>more aggressive as adults. Other studies have found that people behave somewhat more<br>aggressively after watching a violent program. This is especially true for people who<br>have an aggressive personality. Finally, some other research has found that rates of<br>murder tend to increase slightly in the days following a televised boxing match. Nearly all<br>psychologists now agree that violence on television does contribute to aggressive<br>behaviour in everyday life.<br>The issue of violence on television is difficult because it is a conflict between public<br>safety and individual freedom. Some people feel that violent TV should be restricted<br>because it might have harmful effects on society, but other people feel that individuals<br>should be free to watch the programs that they like.<br>",

In these places, the summers are very short, and the winters are extremely<br>cold and dark. However, there are some people who have made this land their home for<br>many generations. These people are called the Inuit. The word @x@Inuit@x@ means @x@person@x@ in<br>the language of the Inuit, which is called Inuktitut.<br>Before modern times, the Inuit had to survive by hunting. Because their homeland was in<br>such a cold, northern place, the Inuit could not make a living by farming or by gathering<br>plants. Many of the animals that the Inuit hunted are mammals that live in the water. For<br>example, the Inuit used boats to hunt whales. Also, they hunted seals by waiting for the<br>seals to rise to the surface of the water. Sometimes, the Inuit would hunt land mammals,<br>such as polar bears.<br>When eating the meat of the animals they had hunted, the Inuit often ate the meat raw.<br>This was necessary because only raw meat could provide them with enough nutrients to<br>survive in a place where fruits and vegetables were not available. In previous times, the<br>Inuit were known as the @x@Eskimos,@x@ which means @x@people who eat raw meat.@x@ However,<br>the Inuit did not like this name.<br>The Inuit invented many useful tools for surviving in the cold, northern areas. They<br>sewed warm clothing from the furs and skins of the animals they hunted. For<br>transportation, they used dogs, which could pull them in sleds across the snow. For<br>making heat and light, they used lamps that burned the fat and oil of whales.<br>The Inuit were famous for their houses made of snow, which were called igloos. The<br>igloos were made by cutting blocks of snow and then using these blocks to build a small<br>round-shaped house. People could enter or exit the igloo through a narrow tunnel.<br>In recent decades, the Inuit have had much contact with the modern world. Inuit children<br>now attend schools, and Inuit adults work at a variety of occupations. In some ways, the<br>Inuit have found it difficult to adjust to the changes from their traditional ways, but the<br>Inuit are meeting this challenge. In Canada, there is a new territory in the far north, called<br>Nunavut, where most of the people, including the leaders, are Inuit.<br>The Inuit are famous for their beautiful artwork. In particular, Inuit carvings or sculptures<br>are known for their excellent quality. These carvings, which nowadays are made from a<br>kind of stone called soapstone, depict people or animals such as bears, seals, or whales.<br>In addition to paintings, Inuit artists have produced beautiful sketches and paintings of<br>northern scenes.<br>",

However, even in these countries, the monarch is a ceremonial figure<br>who no longer has any real power over his or her subjects. These countries are called<br>constitutional monarchies because they are democracies in which the monarch remains<br>the official head of state.<br>Many years ago, the kings and queens of England did have real power, but gradually this<br>power was transferred to the people and their elected officials. It is interesting to<br>examine how this transition occurred.<br>Even in very early times, the king of England did not have absolute power. He was the<br>most powerful man in the country, but he could not entirely force his will upon others. If<br>he became too demanding, he might face opposition from powerful local land-owners.<br>These men, called the barons, might resist a king who tried to become too strong.<br>This is exactly what happened in the year 1215. The king of England had made many<br>unreasonable demands upon the country, and the barons decided to resist. They forced<br>the king to agree to a list of rules that would limit his power. These rules were written in a<br>famous document called the Magna Carta. This document described not only the rights<br>of the barons, but also of the common people of England.<br>During the next few hundred years, the kings still had much power. However, some other<br>people, such as the landowners and the richer men of the towns, also had influence.<br>Their meetings became known as Parliaments, and the king had to share power with the<br>parliament. During the 1640s, one king tried to rule without Parliament, and tried to take<br>away the rights of Parliament. This led to a civil war, and the king was defeated. England<br>soon became a monarchy again, but it became clear that Parliament would have more<br>power than the king. Until the twentieth century, the Parliaments of England became<br>more democratic, as more and more people were allowed to vote.<br>Today, England still has a constitutional monarchy. But not all English-speaking<br>countries recognize the English queen. For example, the United States became an<br>independent country over 200 years ago and has been a republic ever since.<br>In some countries, there is debate about the future of the monarchy. Canada, Australia,<br>and New Zealand still recognize the queen of England as their own queen even though<br>those countries are no longer governed by England. Many people in those countries<br>want to abolish the monarchy. They believe that their countries should now have their<br>own head of state. On the other hand, some people in those countries want to keep the<br>monarchy because it reminds them of their country's early history. This is an ongoing<br>topic of debate for Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders.<br>",

However, the<br>Islamic religion forbids alcohol, so very little alcohol is consumed in this part of the<br>world. In European countries, and in other parts of the world, many different kinds of<br>alcoholic beverages are produced and consumed.<br>In warmer areas of Europe, people make wine by allowing grape juice to ferment. In<br>cooler areas of Europe, people make beer by fermenting liquids made from water and<br>various grains. The process of fermentation is also used to make stronger drinks known<br>as @x@spirits.@x@ These drinks include vodka, whiskey, and rum. The techniques for making<br>good wine, beer, and spirits have been developed over hundreds of years, and require<br>scientific precision. Some people have developed a great appreciation for well-made<br>wine, beer, or spirits, and have become experts about the many different varieties of<br>these beverages.<br>Many people appreciate the taste of alcoholic beverages, but many also enjoy the<br>feelings that alcohol causes. Alcohol belongs to a category of drugs called<br>@x@depressants@x@ because it @x@depresses@x@ the central nervous system, causing a person to<br>feel less inhibited or restrained. Many people enjoy this feeling, but when a person drinks<br>a lot of alcohol, he or she loses co-ordination, balance, and judgment. Speech may<br>become unclear, and the person may speak too much. Some people become aggressive<br>or depressed. When a person is under the influence of alcohol, the person is said to be<br>drunk.<br>One of the problems that can result from alcohol consumption is known as @x@drunk<br>driving.@x@ Some people try to drive a car after having consumed alcohol, but this is<br>extremely dangerous. Each year, thousands of people are killed by drunk drivers who<br>lose control of their cars. In recent years, attempts have been made to reduce this<br>problem, by public education campaigns and by strict laws and punishments. If you drink,<br>don't drive!<br>Another problem associated with alcohol is addiction, known as alcoholism. Some<br>people drink so frequently that they develop a physiological addiction to alcohol. This<br>problem can have terrible consequences for a person's health, personal relationships,<br>and career.<br>Alcoholic beverages are firmly a part of Western culture, and of many other cultures also.<br>On the one hand, drinks provide many people with much enjoyment and appreciation.

          "Most people are aware that Canada and the United States are two very large countries in<br>North America. However, most people do not know how these countries came to exist.<br>The story of the creation of these countries is a very interesting one.<br>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, some people from England and from<br>France moved across the Atlantic ocean. English people lived on what is now the east<br>coast of the United States, and French people lived in what is now Quebec, in the eastern<br>part of Canada. The kings of England and France were often at war with each other. This<br>meant that there was often fighting in North America between the soldiers of England<br>and France.<br>By about the year 1750, there were many more people in the English colonies than in the<br>French colonies. When the next war began, the English king was determined to defeat<br>the French and gain complete control of North America. The English assembled a large<br>force of ships and soldiers and attacked the French at Quebec. The French fought<br>bravely, but they were too few in numbers, and the English won the war. England then<br>gained control of all of North America.<br>After this war, the people of the English colonies in North America began to feel<br>dissatisfied with their government. They were not represented in the English government,<br>but they had to pay taxes to the English king. The taxes were used to pay for English<br>soldiers who defended the American colonies, but the Americans did not want these<br>soldiers.<br>In 1775, the American settlers began to rebel, and in 1776 the Americans declared their<br>independence. For several years, there was much fighting between the Americans and<br>the English soldiers. For a while, it appeared that the Americans would lose, even though<br>they fought bravely. Then, the king of France decided to help the Americans. He sent his<br>ships and soldiers to America, and they helped the Americans to defeat the English<br>forces. England recognized the United States of America as an independent country in<br>1783. However, England kept control of Canada.<br>When the American colonies rebelled against England, some of the people who lived in<br>those colonies did not rebel. Those people were called @x@Loyalists@x@ because they were<br>loyal to the king. When the war ended, the Loyalists had to leave the country. They<br>moved northward to Canada, where they started new English-speaking colonies. During<br>the year 1812, the Americans invaded Canada, but they were not able to conquer the<br>country.<br>During the nineteenth century, the people of Quebec continued to speak French and to<br>maintain their French culture. Meanwhile, many more people moved to the English-<br>speaking areas of Canada. In the year 1867, Quebec and the English-speaking colonies<br>agreed to form a single country, Canada. By this time, there were two very large<br>countries in the northern part of North America!<br>",

The other state is Hawaii, which consists of several islands in the middle of the<br>Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is known as an especially beautiful and interesting place.<br>The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic eruptions that pushed molten rock, called<br>@x@lava,@x@ above the surface of the ocean. Some of the islands no longer have any volcanic<br>activity, but there are still active volcanoes on two Hawaiian islands, Oahu and the @x@big<br>island@x@ (which is known simply as Hawaii). One of these volcanoes, Mauna Loa, still<br>erupts sometimes, with spectacular explosions of lava. Another volcano, called Mauna<br>Kea, is now dormant. These volcanoes are both very tall and reach over 4000 metres<br>above sea level. The air above Mauna Kea is so clear and thin that scientists use the<br>mountain as a base for observing the stars.<br>The islands of Hawaii are located in the tropics, and they are known for their beautiful<br>weather. The temperatures are usually in the range of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, and the<br>days are usually sunny. This weather allows people to enjoy swimming and surfing on<br>the beautiful beaches of Hawaii. Despite the sunshine, most of the islands also receive<br>enough rainfall to support many beautiful flowers and trees.<br>The first people to live in Hawaii were Polynesian groups who arrived from other islands<br>in the Pacific, well over 1000 years ago. The islands were visited by European explorers<br>during the late eighteenth century. During the early nineteenth century, the islands<br>became unified under a single king. However, during this time, many Hawaiians died<br>from diseases that were brought by European and American visitors.<br>The Hawaiian islands are excellent places for growing sugar cane and pineapples. In the<br>late eighteenth century, some Americans began large farms, called @x@plantations,@x@ in<br>Hawaii. The Americans eventually gained control of the government, and Hawaii became<br>a territory of the United States. The United States built a naval base on the island of Oahu,<br>at Pearl Harbor. This base was attacked by Japan in 1941, but it was soon repaired. The<br>naval base is still in use today.<br>During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there was great demand for labour on the<br>sugar and pineapple plantations. People came to Hawaii from many lands, and Hawaii<br>became a place of many cultures. The native Hawaiians mixed with people from places<br>such as Japan, China, Korea, the Philippines, Portugal, and Puerto Rico, as well as the<br>mainland United States. Today, many Hawaiians can claim a diverse heritage.<br>In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States, with the city of Honolulu as its<br>capital. Today, there are more than one million people in Hawaii, more than half of whom<br>live in Honolulu. Each year, many more people visit Hawaii as tourists, to experience the<br>beauty of these islands.<br>",

          "Charles Darwin made what might be the most important scientific discovery of all time-<br>the theory of evolution by natural selection. It was Darwin who first understood how it<br>was that plants and animals evolved over time to produce new and different species. At<br>first, this theory faced much opposition, but since that time it has been supported by<br>evidence from many areas of science.<br>Darwin was born in a small town in England in 1809. When he was a young man, he went<br>to university, first to study medicine, and later to study religion. However, Darwin found<br>his schoolwork to be very boring. Instead, he preferred outdoor activities and was very<br>interested in nature.<br>While Darwin was at university, the British navy was planning to send one of its ships,<br>called the Beagle, on a voyage of exploration. As part of this voyage, the ship would need<br>a naturalist, who could study the various plants and animals that might be found. Darwin<br>was recommended for this job by one of his professors, who had been impressed by<br>Darwin.<br>Darwin was chosen as the naturalist of the Beagle, and the ship left England in 1831. The<br>ship's voyage took Darwin around the world, and he observed many species of plants<br>and animals on his trip. In one place near South America, known as the Galapagos<br>Islands, Darwin observed many unusual species of birds. Several of these birds seemed<br>closely related to each other, but they differed in interesting ways. For example, some<br>birds had long beaks that could reach insects hidden in the bark of trees, but other birds<br>had thick beaks that could break open the shells of nuts.<br>What Darwin realized was that certain characteristics could help an animal (or a plant) to<br>survive and reproduce. Individuals that lacked those characteristics would be more likely<br>to die without reproducing. Over many generations, the useful characteristics would then<br>become more and more common, as the surviving individuals passed the characteristics<br>on to their offspring. Eventually, after many generations, the changes would be so great<br>that a new species would exist. In this way, a single species could divide into two or<br>more new ones. This was called the @x@process of evolution by natural selection.@x@<br>When Darwin returned to England, he studied plants and animals in more detail. After<br>much research, he began writing a book about his theory of evolution by natural<br>selection. When the book, The Origin of Species, was published in 1859, it was very<br>popular and very controversial.<br>During the next twenty years, Darwin continued his scientific research, and he wrote<br>several more books. By the time of his death, in 1882, many biologists had realized that<br>Darwin had made one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time. For the first<br>time, scientists could understand the origin of the many different species of plants and<br>animals.<br>",

In other words, the musician modifies some existing music in a new and<br>interesting way. Syncopation means that the regular patterns found in music may be<br>broken up, with new accents and uneven patterns being created. The features of<br>improvisation and syncopation are difficult to use with skill, and require great creativity<br>on the part of the musician.<br>Jazz music originated in the southern United States, during the late nineteenth and early<br>twentieth centuries. It was based on African-American music that was derived in part<br>from rhythms in western Africa. The earliest jazz musicians were influenced by a music<br>style known as @x@ragtime,@x@ which was popular during the late nineteenth century. Jazz<br>music also incorporated some aspects of a related kind of music called the @x@blues.@x@<br>By the beginning of the twentieth century, a fully developed form of jazz was being<br>played in New Orleans, a city in the southern United States. Jazz musicians played<br>instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone, cornet, and piano. Jazz soon became<br>popular and was played on the riverboats that travelled along the Mississippi River.<br>Some jazz musicians moved north to the city of Chicago, and young musicians in that<br>city developed some new forms of jazz music.<br>By the 1920s and 1930s, jazz was popular in many parts of the United States, and some<br>musicians began forming large bands, comprising many musicians and many different<br>instruments. This began the period known as the @x@big band@x@ era when a popular form of<br>jazz known as @x@swing@x@ music was played.

Located in the southern<br>hemisphere, between the Pacific and Indian oceans, Australia is one of the largest<br>countries in the world.<br>Despite its vast size, Australia does not have a large population. In the year 2000, there<br>were about 19 million people in Australia. Most Australians live within a short distance of<br>the ocean, because much of the interior of Australia is extremely dry. The remote areas of<br>Australia, known as the @x@outback,@x@ contain several sandy, rocky deserts. Some parts of<br>the outback receive somewhat more rainfall, and can support some grassy vegetation. In<br>these areas, there are many ranches, or farms, where sheep and cattle are raised.<br>Although the outback of Australia is a harsh place, some parts of it are quite beautiful. In<br>the middle of the Australian continent, a large red rock known as Uluru stands in the<br>desert. It is nearly 350 metres tall and is nearly 10 kilometres around. Tourists come from<br>all over the world to see this huge and beautiful rock in the middle of a flat desert.<br>In contrast to the dry interior areas, the northern coast of Australia receives a great deal<br>of rainfall. This area is covered in thick, lush vegetation, with tropical rainforests whose<br>exotic trees and flowers are found nowhere else in the world. Off the north-east coast of<br>the continent, a large coral reef known as the Great Barrier Reef is found. A coral reef is a<br>structure that consists of the bodies of small underwater animals called coral, whose<br>dead bodies create this unusual structure beneath the surface of the water. The reef and<br>the underwater life surrounding it are especially beautiful.<br>Australia was separated from the rest of the world for millions of years. As a result, many<br>of the plant and animal species in Australia are very different from those in other parts of<br>the world. For example, many of the animals in Australia belong to a special category<br>called the @x@marsupials.@x@ Marsupials are mammals, but they are a special kind of mammal,<br>because they give birth to offspring that are not yet well developed. In many marsupials,<br>the offspring continue to develop, after being born, inside a pocket or @x@pouch@x@ on the<br>mother's body.<br>The most famous marsupial is the kangaroo. Kangaroos can travel at great speeds by<br>hopping on their hind legs and using their large tails for balance. The kangaroo is a<br>rather large animal, with the larger individuals sometimes weighing 90 kilograms.<br>Another famous marsupial is the koala. This animal is sometimes called a koala bear<br>because it looks somewhat like a small bear. The koala lives in the branches of trees<br>called eucalyptus trees. Koalas eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees.<br>Of course, Australia also has people. We will discuss the people of Australia in the next<br>passage.<br>",

Instead, people<br>believed that the sun moved around the earth.<br>The old idea that the sun moved around the earth is known as the @x@geocentric@x@ theory.<br>This idea was first made famous by an ancient Greek scientist, Ptolemy, who lived in<br>Egypt nearly 2000 years ago. Some other Greek philosophers had suggested instead that<br>the earth might travel around the sun. However, this idea, which is known as the<br>@x@heliocentric@x@ theory, was not widely accepted. For centuries, people in Europe did not<br>seriously question Ptolemy's geocentric theory.<br>During the early fifteenth century, however, a Polish astronomer named Nicolaus<br>Copernicus began to think that the heliocentric idea was right, and that the geocentric<br>idea was wrong. Shortly before his death, Copernicus wrote a book that described the<br>mathematical details of his theory that the earth revolved, or travelled, around the sun.<br>Later astronomers came to agree with Copernicus's view. One of the most famous of<br>these was Galileo, an Italian scientist. Galileo was famous for demonstrating that light<br>and heavy objects fall at exactly the same speed, unless an object is so light that it is<br>slowed by the air. Galileo was also the first astronomer to use a powerful telescope to<br>observe the sky. He discovered many unknown features of the moon, the sun, and the<br>planets.<br>When Galileo announced that he believed in Copernicus's theory that the earth revolved<br>around the sun, some officials of the Roman Catholic Church were angry. They argued<br>that this theory was against the beliefs of the Church. Some church officials disagreed<br>with this view, but the authorities decided that Galileo should be punished by @x@house<br>arrest.@x@ (In other words, Galileo was not allowed to leave his house.) Also, Galileo was<br>forced to make a public statement that renounced his belief in the heliocentric theory.<br>At about the same time that Galileo supported the heliocentric idea, another astronomer<br>did some important work that supported Copernicus's view. This astronomer was<br>Johannes Kepler, who lived in Germany. Kepler used the observations of previous<br>scientists to figure out the motion of the planets around the sun. He realized that the<br>planets did not travel in circular paths, but instead in paths that were elliptical, or oval, in<br>shape.

However, his knowledge of plants was very impressive,<br>and after receiving his Master's degree, he became a teacher at the college he had<br>attended as a student.<br>Soon, however, Carver moved south to the state of Alabama, where he worked as a<br>teacher and researcher at a college for African-American students. It was here that<br>Carver stayed for the rest of his life, and it was here that he performed his important<br>agricultural research.<br>One problem for farmers in the southern United States was that the most widespread<br>crops, cotton and tobacco, tended to remove nutrients from the soil. Carver realized that<br>this problem could be solved, to some extent, by @x@rotating@x@ the cotton and tobacco crops<br>with other kinds of crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, which could help to<br>preserve the nutrients in the soil.<br>Carver's discoveries made the peanut, the sweet potato, and the soybean very useful to<br>southern farmers. He invented the food product known as peanut butter, plus hundreds<br>of other products. For example, Carver found ways to produce plastics, ink, cooking oil,<br>paints, and cosmetics from peanuts and other crops. Carver also developed a new<br>variety of cotton.<br>Carver received many awards for his scientific research, but he was never interested in<br>fame or fortune.

This means that police officers are<br>needed, and so are @x@prosecutors@x@-the lawyers whose job is to make criminal charges<br>against people who break the laws, and to prove that those charges are true. However, it<br>is very important that people's freedoms are not taken away wrongly. People should not<br>be punished unfairly, and people who are accused of crimes must have the opportunity<br>to defend themselves.<br>In some parts of the world, people can be arrested and imprisoned for long periods of<br>time, without any criminal charges being made against them. One of the most important<br>principles of justice in English-speaking countries is that a person cannot be held by the<br>police unless that person is charged with a crime. This principle is known by the Latin<br>term, @x@habeas corpus.@x@ According to the idea of habeas corpus, the police are not<br>allowed to detain a person for more than a certain period of time (usually, twenty-four<br>hours), unless some charge is made against the person. A judge will order the release of<br>a person who is not charged with a crime.<br>Another important feature of justice systems in most English-speaking countries is that<br>accused individuals have the right to be represented by a lawyer. Most accused people<br>want to hire an expert lawyer. However, even if a person cannot afford to hire a lawyer,<br>the criminal court must provide a lawyer who will represent that person. The lawyer for<br>an accused person is required to defend that person as thoroughly as possible.<br>One of the most important aspects of justice systems in the United States and the British<br>Commonwealth is that an accused person must be fully informed of any charges made<br>against them. Also, any evidence that will be used to show the accused person's guilt<br>must be shared with the accused person and with that person's lawyer. In this way,<br>accused persons can challenge the truth of any evidence that will be used against them.<br>Similarly, any person who acts as a witness against an accused person can be cross-<br>examined by the accused person's lawyer. This means that the statements of a witness<br>can be challenged by the accused person.<br>Another important element of most English-speaking justice systems is that evidence<br>must be obtained fairly. Police officers cannot simply enter a person's home to look for<br>evidence of a crime. They must first have a good reason to believe that a crime has been<br>committed, and they must obtain permission from a judge to enter the person's property.<br>This permission is called a @x@search warrant.@x@ Because search warrants are required,<br>people are free from arbitrary invasions of their property by the police.<br>Finally, another important aspect of most English-speaking justice systems is that trials<br>must be held in public, where other citizens can watch the trial. An accused person is not<br>tried secretly. Moreover, as discussed in another passage, the accused person has the<br>right to be tried by a jury of other free citizens. All of these rules ensure that order can be<br>maintained without taking away the freedom of innocent people.<br>",

The city of New York has a population of over seven million people, and the<br>surrounding urban areas bring the total to about twenty million people. However, New<br>York City is not merely a very large city; it is also known as one of the world's leading<br>centers of financial, artistic, and media activities.<br>Compared with most of the great cities of the world, New York is very young. The first<br>permanent settlements were established during the seventeenth century, by settlers from<br>the Netherlands. Those people named their town @x@New Amsterdam.@x@ Soon, the colony<br>was taken over by English settlers, who re-named the city @x@New York.@x@ New York grew<br>quickly, and by the nineteenth century it was the largest city of the United States.<br>New York was usually the place where new immigrants to the United States would arrive.<br>In the nineteenth century, immigrants from Germany and Ireland were numerous in New<br>York. In the early twentieth century, New York City was the home of many Jewish<br>immigrants, and also immigrants from Italy. In addition, many African-American people<br>arrived in New York from other parts of the United States, and many persons came to<br>New York from the American territory of Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking island in the<br>Caribbean. In more recent decades, immigrants have arrived in New York from places all<br>over the world.<br>One of the most famous features of New York City is its dramatic skyline. New York has<br>more tall buildings, called @x@skyscrapers,@x@ than any other city in the world. Many of the<br>tallest and most interesting buildings in New York-including the Woolworth Building, the<br>Chrysler Building, and the Empire State Building-were constructed during the early<br>decades of the twentieth century. In addition to these impressive buildings, New York is<br>also known for the huge bridges that join the island of Manhattan to the surrounding<br>areas. The Brooklyn Bridge is the most famous of these remarkable and old bridges.<br>Of course, New York is famous for much more than just its architecture. New York City's<br>financial district, Wall Street, and its theatre district, centered on Broadway, are the most<br>important in the United States. Central Park is one of the world's great urban parks, and<br>the art galleries, museums, and concert halls are among the greatest to be found<br>anywhere. The United Nations has its headquarters in New York City. People around the<br>world recognize the famous Statue of Liberty, which stands on an island in the harbor of<br>New York, and the bustling Times Square, located in the mid-town Manhattan area.<br>Visitors to New York find it to be an extremely busy, fast-placed city and are struck by the<br>extremes of wealth and poverty that surround it. Many people love New York City, but<br>even those who would not want to live in New York do agree that it is a very interesting<br>place.<br>",

          "By far the most populous state of the United States is California. Located in the<br>southwestern corner of the United States, California is home to a great diversity of<br>natural environments and cultural influences. In the year 2000, over 33 million people<br>lived in California.<br>California's many mountains and valleys produce a wide variety of climates and natural<br>regions. In the interior, southeastern parts of the state are many areas of desert. For<br>example, Death Valley, which is so deep that it is below sea level, is extremely dry.<br>Temperatures in Death Valley sometimes exceed 50 degrees Celsius. Other valleys are<br>more pleasant and hospitable places. In the central valley, many farms grow vast<br>amounts of fruits and vegetables.<br>California also contains many tall, snow-covered mountains. On the slopes of some<br>mountains are forests that have very large trees. Some of the giant redwood trees of<br>California reach heights of 100 metres or more.<br>Many of the cities in California have Spanish names. This is because many of those cities<br>began as religious missions that were started by Spanish priests. Mexico owned<br>California during the early nineteenth century, but few Mexican people lived there. The<br>United States gained control of California during the 1840s, and the discovery of gold<br>brought many Americans and others to California.<br>Today, California contains some of the largest cities in the United States. Within the<br>greater Los Angeles area, one can find Hollywood, known as the movie capital of the<br>world. Many rich people live in suburbs such as Beverly Hills, and many poor people live<br>in other neighborhoods throughout the city. The Los Angeles area is home to over 15<br>million people, many of whom have immigrated to the United States from Mexico and<br>from many Asian countries. Los Angeles is a very large city that has spread across a<br>great area. As a consequence, the city has many traffic jams and air pollution, or smog,<br>is sometimes a problem.<br>Further north is the city of San Francisco, one of the most beautiful cities of the United<br>States. The image of the Golden Gate Bridge, which crosses the harbour of San<br>Francisco, is famous around the world. Also famous are the hilly streets of San<br>Francisco and the trolley cars that provide transportation along them. San Francisco's<br>Chinese community is one of the largest in North America, and the city also contains a<br>vibrant artistic and cultural life. San Francisco was destroyed by an earthquake in 1906<br>and was damaged again in 1989.<br>California has always had a special place in the imagination of Americans. This is hardly<br>surprising, given the variety and diversity of this vast state!<br>",

        Title: "Drug Use Among Athletes",
        Content:
          "Drug use is a common problem in many sports competitions today. In both professional<br>and amateur sports, many athletes use drugs that are designed to improve athletic<br>performance. The use of these drugs may have harmful effects on the future health of<br>athletes, but they also give an unfair advantage in athletic competitions.<br>Some of the most widely-used performance-enhancing drugs are called @x@anabolic<br>steroids.@x@ Anabolic steroids are drugs that are very similar to the male hormone,<br>testosterone. These drugs allow athletes to develop larger and stronger muscles, and to<br>increase the intensity of training. For sports that require strength, power, or speed, the<br>use of steroids can provide advantages. In past years, many famous sprinters and<br>weightlifters have been found to have used steroids.<br>However, anabolic steroids have many negative side effects. To give just a few examples,<br>steroids can cause changes in mood, including irritability and anger, and can also cause<br>skin problems such as acne. In men, steroid use can lead to reduction in the functioning<br>of the testicles. In women, steroid use can interfere with menstruation. In both men and<br>women, long-term side effects include an increased risk of some forms of cancer.<br>Another widely-used drug is known as EPO. EPO is a hormone that helps to produce red<br>blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles. When taken by athletes who compete in<br>sports that require great endurance, EPO may provide an advantage by allowing the<br>athletes to maintain their speed for a longer time and distance. During 1998, there was a<br>scandal at a famous bicycle race, the Tour de France, when it was found that many of<br>these long-distance cyclists were using EPO to gain an advantage over their competitors.<br>EPO has side effects. For example, it increases the likelihood of developing blood clots,<br>which increase the risk of a stroke or heart attack.<br>One difficulty in preventing the use of performance-enhancing drugs is that it is not<br>always possible to detect the use of the drugs. Tests have been developed to detect the<br>drugs, but new varieties of the drugs are often not detected. Also, athletes who stop<br>using the drugs well before a drug test may avoid being detected.<br>Preventing the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletes is difficult, but it is<br>important. Most athletes want to compete without using artificial substances that provide<br>easy advantages, and they do not want to risk their health by using these substances. If<br>those athletes are to have a fair chance, it is necessary to prevent other athletes from<br>gaining advantages due to the use of these drugs.<br>",

          "Scotland is the country that is located on the northern part of the island of Great Britain.<br>The Scottish people are one of the four main nationalities of the British Isles, together<br>with the English, the Welsh, and the Irish. Scotland and its people have played an<br>important part in the history of the English-speaking world.<br>Scotland can be roughly divided into two main regions. The lowland areas, in the<br>southern part of Scotland, contain most of the population and the two main cities,<br>Edinburgh and Glasgow. Most of Scotland's agriculture and industry are located in the<br>lowland areas. The Highland areas, together with the islands that lie off the coast of<br>Scotland, are not so heavily populated. The lakes and mountains of the highlands are<br>known for their beautiful scenery.<br>One of the main themes of Scottish history is conflict with England. During the Middle<br>Ages, the English and Scottish kings were often at war. Around the year 1300, the Scots<br>repelled some invasions from England. During the 1600s, though, Scotland and England<br>had the same king, and the countries were officially joined as @x@the United Kingdom@x@ in<br>1701.<br>For people in the highlands of Scotland, the eighteenth century was very difficult. Most<br>people worked as farmers on land that was owned by a few wealthy landlords. The<br>landlords decided that they could make more money on the land if they evicted the<br>farmers, so many of the farmers were forced to leave. The highlanders rebelled against<br>the King in 1745, but they were defeated. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,<br>many people left the highlands of Scotland. They moved to the United States, Canada,<br>Australia, and New Zealand. During the nineteenth century, Scotland was the first<br>country to have universal public education for children. The country produced a great<br>number of famous scientists and inventors during that time.<br>Scotland is famous for its national costume. This costume includes the @x@kilt,@x@ which is a<br>knee-length skirt worn by both men and women. The kilt is made from a fabric that<br>contains stripes of different colors and widths, which cross over each other to produce a<br>pattern that is called a @x@tartan.@x@ In the Scottish highlands, groups of related families,<br>called @x@clans,@x@ have their own unique tartan.<br>Another famous part of Scottish heritage is the musical instrument known as the<br>bagpipes. The bagpipes have a distinctive sound that is easily recognized. Bagpipes<br>were originally played to intimidate enemies in battle, but today Scottish people play the<br>bagpipes at parades and other celebrations. People of Scottish heritage around the world<br>celebrate their heritage on January 25th of each year. This day celebrates the birthday of<br>Robbie Burns, the famous Scottish poet. People celebrate this day at parties, where<br>people eat a famous Scottish food called haggis.<br>Today, Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom, but some Scottish people would<br>like Scotland to become independent. Whatever the Scottish people decide, their country<br>will remain a unique and interesting place.<br>",

The city contains, in addition to people of<br>English background, large communities of South Asian, Chinese, African, and Caribbean<br>people. Most of these people have their origins in countries that belong to the British<br>Commonwealth of Nations.<br>Many of the most famous buildings in London are located in a small central area. This<br>area contains several huge churches, including Westminster Abbey, where many famous<br>people are buried. Another famous church is St. Paul's Cathedral, which was re-built after<br>the original was destroyed by fire in the year 1665.<br>The Houses of Parliament are also found in central London.

The basic rules of the sport are simple:<br>two teams of eleven players try to kick the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal.<br>Only one player on each team, the goal-keeper, is allowed to touch the ball with hands or<br>arms. Perhaps part of the reason for the popularity of soccer is its simplicity. The game<br>requires no expensive equipment, merely a ball and a playing surface, preferably a large<br>grassy area. For children in most parts of the world, soccer is the sport that is played<br>most widely.<br>Soccer is also known as football, especially in England. However, soccer should not be<br>confused with American Football, Australian Rules Football, and Rugby Football, which<br>are very different sports.<br>Although the basic rules of soccer are easy to learn, it is very difficult to master the skills<br>of the game. The best soccer players have developed, through natural talent and hard<br>work, a remarkable ability to control the soccer ball with their feet, knees, torso, and<br>head. They can pass the ball very accurately, or shoot the ball very hard.<br>The most famous soccer tournament is the World Cup. Every four years, teams<br>representing countries from around the world play in a tournament to decide which<br>country has the best soccer team in the world.<br>Because soccer is such a popular sport, it is not possible for every country in the world<br>to be represented at the World Cup tournament. To decide which countries may<br>participate in the World Cup, it is necessary to have tournaments within various regions<br>of the world. The countries that perform well within their parts of the world can then<br>proceed to the World Cup. In the past, most of the available places at the World Cup have<br>been reserved for teams from Europe and from South America. The reason for this is that<br>soccer has been extremely popular in these continents, which have produced the<br>winning teams in previous World Cup tournaments.<br>Recently, however, several African and Asian countries have played quite well at the<br>World Cup, so there are now additional places provided for teams from Africa and Asia.<br>Someday, teams from these areas will win the World Cup. However, there will no doubt<br>be strong competition from countries that have traditionally had very strong teams, such<br>as Argentina, England, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.<br>In many parts of the world, soccer has been an increasingly popular sport for women.<br>There are now many soccer leagues and tournaments available for women athletes, and<br>it seems likely that the number of women who play soccer will someday equal the<br>number of men who play soccer.

        Content:
          "Ever since human beings appeared on the Earth, we have had a serious impact on other<br>living things. One of the most serious results of the human presence has been the<br>extinction of other species. Since the arrival of humans, many species of animals and<br>plants have died out as a result of human activity.<br>The extinction of species is a serious problem. When certain species are eliminated, this<br>may disrupt the balance of nature, leading to overpopulation of some species and<br>extinction of others. These changes may have an impact on humans. Also, some of the<br>species that become extinct might have had benefits for human beings. For example,<br>scientists believe that some of the plants growing in rain forest areas might be valuable<br>for treating human diseases. If these plants become extinct as a result of human activity,<br>then these treatments will never be found.<br>The earliest extinctions caused by humans occurred very long ago. Modern humans<br>emerged in Africa over 100,000 years ago, and some of those people migrated to other<br>parts of the world. When they reached new areas, they found that it was very easy to hunt<br>the large animals, which had not previously been hunted by humans. As these<br>prehistoric people moved into Europe, Australia, and the Americas, they killed large<br>numbers of large animals. Within a few hundred years, many species of animals had<br>become extinct. For example, prehistoric people reached New Zealand less than 1000<br>years ago, but they soon hunted a huge bird, called the giant moa, to extinction.<br>With the beginnings of modern technology, several hundred years ago, many other<br>species were driven to extinction. Hunters armed with guns were able to kill vast<br>numbers of animals. In North America, this led to the extinction of bird species such as<br>the passenger pigeon, which had previously been very numerous. Other species were<br>nearly wiped out, such as the large prairie mammals called bison. There were once<br>millions of these animals, but now only a few thousand remain.<br>Today, many more species of animals and plants are going extinct. Sometimes this<br>happens because of human expansion into areas that are the habitat of certain species.<br>When people clear a forest, some species may be lost.<br>In the near future, many other extinctions are possible or likely. In some cases, the<br>problem is due to human greed. For example, some people buy ivory that is taken from<br>the bodies of animals such as elephants or rhinoceros. Hunters sometimes kill these<br>animals simply to take their ivory, and the result is a tragic decline in populations.<br>Another example involves bears in North America. Some people buy the sexual organs of<br>these animals for use as aphrodisiacs, or sexual stimulants. The result is that hunters kill<br>bears simply to obtain these organs, and this leads to a reduction in the number of bears.<br>Fortunately, many countries have laws to prevent the hunting of species that are facing<br>extinction, known as @x@endangered species.@x@ However, some hunting of these endangered<br>animals continues. Only by refusing to buy the products that are made from endangered<br>species can we prevent this terrible crime.<br>",

          "For people in many countries, one of the great triumphs of modern life is that there is a<br>great abundance of food. In those places, problems such as starvation and malnutrition<br>are no longer prevalent, and people do not worry about going hungry.<br>Despite the fact that there is plenty of food in modern countries, people still face many<br>health problems that are related to their diet. One problem is that modern technology has<br>made it possible to produce cheap and tasty food that is not very healthy. This leads to<br>the problem that many people are obese, or very overweight.<br>One example of this is the @x@fast food@x@ that is served by many restaurants. This food is<br>often cooked by frying. Fried food contains a high proportion of fat. Also, fast food meals<br>are often very large. When people frequently eat large amounts of fried @x@fast food,@x@ they<br>will likely eat too much fat. This excess can lead to weight gain. Of course, many people<br>enjoy the taste of fried fast food and like to eat it occasionally. However, eating this kind<br>of food too often is bad for one's health.<br>Another example of health problems caused by modern food products involves soft<br>drinks and other sweetened beverages. These drinks, sometimes called @x@pop,@x@ have a<br>sweet taste that many people enjoy on occasion. However, these drinks contain large<br>amounts of sugar. When people drink soft drinks very frequently, they consume a great<br>deal of sugar. This excess sugar can lead to weight gain.<br>The weight gain that can result from consuming too much fast food and too many soft<br>drinks can have several harmful effects. For example, people who are very obese have an<br>increased risk of heart disease and of diabetes. Of course, fast food and soft drinks are<br>not the only causes of obesity. Other eating habits may be involved, and so are lack of<br>exercise and genetic factors.<br>To avoid the health problems that are associated with obesity, it is important that one<br>does not eat too much food. However, this does not mean that one should try to eat as<br>little as possible. People need an adequate amount of food in order to stay healthy. Also,<br>it is important to avoid new @x@fad@x@ diets that become popular from time to time, because<br>these are often unsafe. Some of the diets that are recommended in popular books do not<br>contain adequate amounts of nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals.<br>Instead, one should try to eat foods that are nutritious. For example, foods such as fruits,<br>vegetables, grains, and lean meats have many vitamins and minerals that are needed for<br>good health. People whose diet consists mainly of these foods will probably be much<br>healthier, on average, than people whose diet contains too many foods that have high<br>levels of fat or sugar. In addition, many of these nutritious foods are also very tasty and<br>enjoyable to eat!<br>",

        Content:
          "When an employee is subjected to unwanted sexual advances or comments by a co-<br>worker or an employer, we say that the employee is experiencing sexual harassment. In<br>some workplaces, sexual harassment is a serious problem.<br>In its most blatant form, a boss may demand sexual favours from an employee and<br>threaten to fire the employee if she fails to comply. Similarly, the employer might promise<br>a promotion or raise in exchange for some sexual favor. Whenever an employer uses the<br>prospect of reward or punishment as a way of obtaining sexual access to an employee,<br>sexual harassment has occurred.<br>This is not the only form of sexual harassment. Sometimes, an employee may be<br>subjected to demeaning comments by her employer or co-worker. For example, a boss<br>might make vulgar comments about the physical appearance of the employee. Another<br>example is that a co-worker might make remarks that speculate about the sexual<br>behaviour of the employee. In both of these cases, the employee is treated<br>disrespectfully on the basis of her sex, so both cases would represent sexual<br>harassment.<br>Some forms of sexual harassment are more subtle. If a group of workers exchanges<br>offensive jokes of a sexual nature, in such a way that they can be easily overheard by<br>other workers, then this is also a form of sexual harassment. Similarly, if workers post<br>pornographic pictures in their workplace, in such a way that they can be seen by other<br>workers, then this also represents sexual harassment. In both cases, the workplace<br>becomes an environment in which the employee is made to feel uncomfortable because<br>of her sex.<br>Sexual harassment usually involves a female employee who is being bothered by a male<br>employer or co-worker. In some cases, a woman might sexually harass a man, or one<br>person might sexually harass another person of the same sex. However, these cases are<br>not as common. Also, in some cases, the person who commits sexual harassment is not<br>a boss or co-worker, but a customer or a visitor to the workplace.<br>Sexual harassment is a form of intimidation and abuse of power that causes much stress<br>for many employees. In recent years, many steps have been taken to reduce the<br>occurrence of sexual harassment. Educational campaigns have been designed to teach<br>people that sexual harassment is wrong. Stronger penalties for sexual harassment have<br>been introduced.<br>Another way to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment is to develop a culture of<br>respect in the workplace. People need to be aware of how their jokes or comments might<br>be perceived by others, and to imagine how they would feel if one of their relatives were<br>subjected to sexual harassment. Employers and employees must recognize that sexual<br>harassment is a serious concern and treat potential cases of sexual harassment very<br>seriously. Each company should have clear policies about sexual harassment, and each<br>should establish a fair and efficient process for dealing with complaints of this kind. In<br>this way, the workplace can be a comfortable environment for all persons.<br>",

        Title: "Cultural Differences : Individualism and Collectivism",
        Content:
          "The many cultures of the world differ in a great variety of ways. One of the most<br>interesting ways in which cultures vary is in the extent to which they are @x@individualistic@x@<br>or @x@collectivistic.@x@ An individualist society and a collectivist society are different in many<br>ways.<br>In an individualistic culture, each person tends to think of himself or herself in terms of<br>his or her own characteristics and preferences-the things that make the person unique or<br>different from others. In a collectivistic culture, each person tends to think of himself or<br>herself in terms of his or her social relationships and roles-the things that make the<br>person a part of a larger group, such as an extended family or an ethnic group.<br>Another difference between individualist and collectivist cultures involves the tendency<br>to help others. In an individualist society, people feel some obligation to help persons<br>who share some group identity-such as their distant relatives, or persons from the same<br>town-but this obligation is not nearly as strong as in collectivist cultures. On the other<br>hand, people in collectivist cultures tend to feel very little inclination to help other people<br>who do not belong to their groups, whereas people in individualist cultures are more<br>often willing to help others even if they do not belong to the same group.<br>Another difference between individualist and collectivist cultures involves the<br>relationship between people and the groups to which they belong. In an individualist<br>culture, people usually join or leave groups when it is in their personal interest to do so.<br>In a collectivist culture, people usually stay with one group for a long time. For example,<br>people in individualist societies are more willing to quit their job, and take a new job at<br>another company. People in collectivist societies usually prefer to stay with one company<br>throughout their career. Similarly, people in individualist countries usually get married<br>for reasons of personal choice, and are more likely to get divorced. However, people in<br>collectivist societies usually get married according to the wishes of their relatives, and<br>are less likely to get divorced.<br>Western countries, such as those of western Europe and North America, are usually<br>considered to be very individualist. However, not all individualist countries are similar in<br>every way. For example, the individualism of the United States is viewed as more<br>@x@competitive@x@ than that of socialist countries, such as Sweden. In contrast to Western<br>countries, the countries of most parts of Asia and Africa are usually considered to be<br>very collectivist. Collectivist countries also differ from each other in many ways.<br>The idea of individualism versus collectivism is an interesting way to understand some<br>of the differences between cultures. By learning about ideas like this, one can better<br>appreciate the customs of other peoples.<br>",

        Title: "The Protestant Reformation",
        Content:
          "Until about 500 years ago, there was only one Christian church in western and central<br>Europe. People from Portugal to Poland all belonged to the Roman Catholic Church.<br>However, soon after the year 1500, people in many parts of Europe broke away from the<br>Roman Catholic Church and began their own churches instead. This was known as the<br>Protestant Reformation.<br>The leader of the early Protestant movement was a German theologian named Martin<br>Luther. Luther believed that many of the priests of the Roman Catholic Church had<br>become too concerned about wealth and luxury. Also, he disapproved of some practices<br>in the Church. One such practice was that priests allowed people to pay money to the<br>Church in exchange for committing various sins. Luther believed that it was wrong to<br>allow people to buy the freedom to commit acts that were against the teachings of the<br>Church.<br>Luther began to criticize the Roman Catholic Church in public, and he refused to<br>acknowledge the authority of the Church. He said that instead he would follow the<br>teachings of the Bible as he understood them. The officials of the Church declared that<br>Luther was a heretic. However, the local German rulers did not punish Luther. Many of<br>them resented the power of the Church and welcomed his ideas.<br>Luther and other Protestant leaders disagreed with the Church on several important<br>issues. The Protestants believed that priests should be allowed to marry, whereas the<br>Roman Catholic Church believed that priests should remain celibate. The Protestants<br>believed that people should read the Bible for themselves, whereas the Roman Catholic<br>Church believed that priests should interpret the Bible for the people.<br>During the decades that followed Luther, the Protestant movement spread throughout<br>much of Europe. Over time, many different Protestant churches were formed. During this<br>period, many wars were fought between local rulers who favoured Protestantism, and<br>other local rulers who supported the Roman Catholic Church. In the end, many parts of<br>Europe became Protestant, such as Scandinavia, England, and parts of Germany, Holland,<br>and Switzerland.<br>However, the people and rulers of many other areas of Europe preferred to remain in the<br>Roman Catholic Church. These areas included most of southern Europe, as well as<br>Poland and Ireland. The Roman Catholic Church changed a few of its practices in<br>response to Protestant criticism, but kept its most important beliefs.<br>In recent times, relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant<br>churches have become much more friendly. Some discussions have been held between<br>Catholic and Protestant officials, in order to resolve some of their disagreements.<br>",

        Content:
          "During the twentieth century, there were great improvements in engineering technology.<br>These new developments allowed the construction of many amazing tunnels, bridges,<br>towers, and office buildings.<br>For centuries, people had dreamed about the possibility of connecting the island of Great<br>Britain to the mainland of Europe. However, it was only in 1994 that such a link was<br>completed, when a tunnel was dug under the English Channel, between England and<br>France. The Channel Tunnel, also known as the @x@Chunnel,@x@ actually consists of three<br>separate railway tunnels. These tunnels are about 50 kilometres long. They are located<br>about 150 metres below the bottom of the sea. Obviously, this was an extremely<br>challenging project to undertake. As a result of the Chunnel, it is now possible to travel<br>between London and Paris by train. And the trip takes only three hours, of which only 20<br>minutes are spent inside the tunnel!<br>A suspension bridge is a bridge that is supported by strong wires that hang from tall<br>towers. The world's longest suspension bridge is the Akashi-Kaikyo bridge, near the city<br>of Kobe, Japan. This bridge is nearly 4 kilometres long, and the two towers near the<br>middle of the bridge are about 2 kilometres apart! It took almost 20 years to design this<br>bridge, and 10 years to build it. This bridge was designed to withstand extremely strong<br>winds, because Japan often experiences wind storms called typhoons. The bridge was<br>also designed to withstand powerful earthquakes, which sometimes hit Japan.<br>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world's tallest free-standing tower was<br>the Canadian National Tower, or the CN Tower. The CN tower is 553 metres tall. It is<br>located in the city of Toronto, within the Canadian province of Ontario. This structure was<br>built in 1975 as a television and radio tower. Before the CN tower was built, TV and radio<br>reception in the Toronto area was poor. This was because the TV and radio signals were<br>blocked by the buildings of downtown Toronto. When the CN tower was built, this<br>problem was solved. Of course, the CN tower is also a famous tourist attraction. People<br>can ride in the very fast elevators that take them to observation areas, which are at about<br>350 and 450 metres above the ground.<br>Although the CN Tower is the world's tallest tower, it is not an office building. The tallest<br>buildings in the world are the Petronas Towers, in the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,<br>and the Sears Tower, in the American city of Chicago. The Sears Tower, which is 442<br>metres tall, was completed in 1974. It has 110 floors, and its top floor is the highest office<br>floor in the world. However, the Petronas Towers reach slightly higher, to a height of 452<br>metres. The Petronas Towers were completed in 1998.<br>Obviously, the late twentieth century witnessed some amazing achievements of<br>engineering. It will be very interesting to see what new wonders will be constructed in the<br>twenty-first century!<br>",

          "The story of Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller is the story of a dedicated teacher and an<br>eager student. This story is very remarkable and inspiring because the teaching was<br>done without sight and without sound.<br>Helen Keller was born in the American state of Alabama in 1880. She was a happy and<br>healthy baby, but before she reached the age of two, she was struck by a severe fever. As<br>a result of this fever, she became both deaf and blind.<br>After her illness, the young Helen Keller learned to use her other senses. For example,<br>she touched other people's hands to figure out what they were doing. In this way, she<br>also learned that people could communicate by moving their lips. Helen could not talk;<br>instead, she communicated with her family by making sign movements with her hands<br>and body. However, Helen became very frustrated by her inability to see, hear, and talk.<br>She often became very angry and had many @x@temper tantrums.@x@<br>When Helen Keller was six years old, her family took her to see Dr. Alexander Graham<br>Bell, who was an expert on educating deaf children. (This man was also famous for<br>inventing the telephone.) As a result of this visit, Helen's parents hired a tutor for their<br>daughter. The tutor was a very intelligent deaf woman named Anne Sullivan.<br>At first, it was difficult to teach Helen because she still made many angry outbursts.<br>Gradually, Anne Sullivan gained Helen's trust. One day, Anne began to teach Helen to<br>communicate. Anne took Helen to a well and pumped some water onto Helen's hand.<br>Then, Anne used her finger to write the letters w-a-t-e-r onto Helen's hand. By repeating<br>this, Anne was able to teach Helen how to write the word @x@water.@x@<br>As soon as Helen learned that things could be named in this way, she wanted to learn the<br>names of many other objects and actions. She was curious about many things, and<br>learned a great number of words. She also learned to read by using the Braille alphabet.<br>This alphabet allows the reader to feel letters and words, which are represented by<br>bumps on a page. Also, Helen learned to talk, by feeling and then copying the<br>movements of people's mouths.<br>When Helen Keller was 16 years old, Anne Sullivan went with her to college. Anne acted<br>as Helen's interpreter, and Helen was very successful in her studies. After her graduation,<br>Helen dedicated her life to improving conditions for the blind, the deaf, and the poor.<br>Anne Sullivan died in 1936 and was remembered as the @x@Miracle Worker@x@ for her triumph<br>in educating Helen Keller.<br>After Anne's death, Helen continued to give lectures in countries around the world, and<br>was active in many political causes. She met with presidents and prime ministers, and<br>helped to improve conditions for people who were deaf or blind. At the time of her death,<br>in 1968, Helen Keller was one of the most admired people in the world.<br>",

        Content:
          "In many ways, the automobile has been one of the most important inventions of the<br>modern age. People have been able to travel much more freely, and across much greater<br>distances, than was possible in the past. The automobile, which most people refer to as<br>the @x@car,@x@ has also had some harmful consequences, such as pollution and accidents.<br>However, it is clear that life has changed profoundly as a result of the car.<br>Modern cars are very complicated, but the basic idea of how a car works can be<br>described briefly. When the keys are turned in the ignition of the car, this creates a spark<br>that ignites some gasoline vapour inside a cylinder. Then, the rapid expansion of this<br>vapour pushes against a part called a piston. The movement of the piston then causes a<br>turning motion in a shaft that is connected to the wheels. The wheels turn, and the car<br>moves.<br>The invention of the car, and the engines used by cars, happened gradually in the late<br>nineteenth century, mainly in France and Germany. In the early twentieth century, an<br>American engineer named Henry Ford developed a new way of making cars. Instead of<br>having one worker produce an entire car, he had each worker perform one part of the<br>production of many different cars. This system was very efficient and allowed the mass<br>production of cars. The first car to be produced in large numbers was called the @x@Model<br>T.@x@<br>The Model T Ford and other cars that were soon produced in large numbers were cheap<br>enough that many people could afford to buy them. Many new roads were built and<br>paved throughout North America to allow cars to be driven from town to town. People<br>were able to travel much more easily and to visit places that had previously been difficult<br>to reach.<br>Some problems also came with the widespread use of cars. One of these problems was<br>air pollution, because car engines burn gasoline, which produces poisonous exhaust<br>fumes. Gradually, new laws and new technology have led to reductions in the air<br>pollution that is caused by cars. Moreover, cars today are much more @x@fuel efficient@x@ than<br>they were in the past, requiring less gasoline to travel a given distance. However, this<br>pollution is still a problem because of the many millions of cars that are used each day.<br>Another problem has been car accidents, which have caused many thousands of deaths<br>each year. During the 1960s, some journalists brought attention to the unsafe features of<br>many cars. As a result, the safety of cars has been greatly improved. In addition, the use<br>of seat belts is now required by law. However, car accidents continue to be a serious<br>problem.<br>The future is likely to bring many interesting new changes to the car. Improvements in<br>the safety of cars, in fuel efficiency, and in the cleanliness of car emissions are<br>continuing to be made. Also, the increasing use of the car in economically developing<br>countries will probably have important effects upon people's lives around the world.<br>",

        Title: "Sexual Attitude and Behavior",
        Content:
          "During the past several decades, there have been major changes within most Western<br>countries in people's attitudes toward sex, and in sexual behaviour. For people who have<br>lived throughout this period, the changes have seemed quite remarkable.<br>Until the early twentieth century, people in most Western countries did not have<br>permissive attitudes regarding sexuality. For the most part, young people were expected<br>to wait until marriage before having sexual intercourse. Of course, some premarital sex<br>did occur, and prostitution was not rare. However, sexual behaviour was relatively<br>restricted.<br>As the twentieth century progressed, there was a gradual trend toward liberalization of<br>attitudes toward sex. However, this trend was greatly speeded after 1960, when the first<br>birth control pills became available. These contraceptive pills made it possible for<br>women to engage in sexual intercourse without much risk of an unwanted pregnancy. As<br>a result, many women were more willing to have premarital sex than was previously the<br>case.<br>Also during the 1960s, Western countries were reaching high levels of wealth and<br>education. A new and very large generation of young people was approaching adulthood,<br>and there was a mood of rebellion against traditional norms. There was an increase in<br>the number of people who engaged in sex before marriage, and also a greater openness<br>about such behaviour.<br>By the 1970s, sexual attitudes had become quite liberal, and many young people were<br>quite promiscuous in their sexual behaviour. However, this pattern reversed somewhat<br>during the 1980s. There was increased concern about sexually transmitted diseases,<br>including AIDS; moreover, many young women had been uncomfortable with the idea of<br>unrestricted sexual behaviour. As a result, sexual attitudes became slightly more<br>conservative during the 1980s and 1990s, although they remained much more liberal<br>than in previous decades.<br>In the early twenty-first century, most young people in Western countries begin having<br>sex during their high school years, although some people wait until they are<br>considerably older. Some young people are promiscuous, but most engage in<br>monogamous relationships that typically last for a period of several months or a few<br>years. When one relationship ends, another usually begins soon after. This pattern<br>usually continues until marriage. After marriage, most people have sex exclusively with<br>their spouse; however, some people do commit adultery.<br>Sexuality has changed a great deal in recent decades. It will be very interesting to see<br>how people's sexual attitudes and behaviour will change in the future.<br>",

This river holds a special place in American history and literature, and<br>in the imagination of ordinary Americans.<br>The Mississippi River begins in the hills of northern Minnesota, near the Canadian border,<br>and flows southward about 3700 kilometres, through ten states, before draining its water<br>and silt into the Gulf of Mexico. Traditionally, the river is viewed as a natural boundary<br>between the eastern and western halves of the United States.<br>Until the year 1803, the areas to the west of the Mississippi River, and the areas around<br>the mouth of the river, were claimed by Spain and by France. In that year, the French<br>emperor, Napoleon, decided to sell this land to the United States of America. This sale,<br>which is called the Louisiana Purchase, was very important for the United States. By<br>controlling the Mississippi River, the Americans would be able to use it for transporting<br>goods and people in this rapidly developing area.<br>For many years, river-boats were the main method of long-distance transportation for<br>people living near the Mississippi. Steam-powered boats, with large @x@paddle wheels@x@ that<br>pushed the boat forward, were very popular in the time before cars and airplanes.<br>One of the famous cities along the Mississippi River is St. Louis. This city is known as<br>the @x@gateway to the west.@x@ During the nineteenth century, St. Louis was the last large<br>town that people would pass through on their way to new farmland farther west. Today,<br>St. Louis is famous for the @x@Gateway Arch,@x@ a tall monument that welcomes people to the<br>west. St. Louis is also known as the city where the music known as @x@the Blues@x@ began.<br>Near the mouth of the Mississippi River is another famous city, New Orleans. In terms of<br>the style of buildings, New Orleans is said to be the most unusual American city, because<br>it is influenced so strongly by Spanish and French traditions. Even today, the traditional<br>festival of @x@Mardi Gras@x@ is celebrated in New Orleans each year. New Orleans and the<br>surrounding areas of the state of Louisiana are famous for spicy @x@Cajun@x@ food.

The organization<br>helps people regardless of their nationality, race, religion, ethnicity, sex, or political<br>opinions. Also, the assistance provided by Doctors Without Borders is given in response<br>to all kinds of disasters, such as famines, earthquakes, and wars.<br>The people who belong to Doctors Without Borders are experienced medical workers<br>who volunteer their time, effort, and skills in an attempt to help people who are in need.<br>These volunteers include doctors, nurses, surgeons, anesthetists, laboratory technicians,<br>and other medical workers. There are also some non-medical volunteers who work for<br>Doctors Without Borders in positions of administration or logistics.<br>Volunteers must first take a course before participating in a humanitarian mission. They<br>promise to abide by a code of professional ethics, and they promise to remain neutral in<br>any conflicts within a disaster area. A mission typically lasts about six months, but the<br>duration varies. The volunteers are insured by the organization, but they are not paid in<br>any way for their work.<br>When Doctors Without Borders began in 1971, it consisted of only a few French doctors<br>who wanted to provide humanitarian aid to people in disaster areas. Over the years, it<br>grew rapidly, and by 2001, Doctors Without Borders had 2500 volunteers working in 80<br>countries around the world.

The city's central location has made its O'Hare International Airport the @x@hub@x@<br>for most airlines in the United States. Its location on the shores of Lake Michigan has<br>made it a major port and business centre, where the agricultural and industrial products<br>of the American Midwest are shipped overseas.<br>Until about the 1830s, Chicago was a minor trading post. But then it grew rapidly as the<br>most important town in the rapidly developing areas of the midwestern United States. In<br>1871, the city was destroyed by a fire. It is often said that the fire started when a cow<br>knocked over an oil lamp. It took about 20 years for the city to be completely rebuilt, but<br>it continued to expand. In 1882, the first skyscraper was built in Chicago.<br>Around the turn of the century, the population of Chicago was growing quickly. Many<br>African-American people moved to Chicago from the southern United States, and many<br>immigrants from Eastern Europe also arrived in Chicago during this time. Because of the<br>busy and active atmosphere of the city, an American poet described Chicago as @x@the city<br>of broad shoulders.@x@<br>Chicago became notorious for organized crime during the Prohibition Era of the 1920s,<br>when the sale of alcohol was illegal.

But it was not so long ago that women did not have this<br>right. Only after a long struggle did women gain the right to vote.<br>By the early nineteenth century, modern democratic forms of government were<br>appearing in the United States, Great Britain, and some European countries. In these<br>countries, most adult men had the right to vote in democratic elections. Some men were<br>denied this right if they were poor or if they belonged to a racial minority group, but<br>gradually this right was extended to all men.<br>It took much longer for women to gain the right to vote. Only in special cases, such as<br>that of a widow who owned land, could a woman be allowed to vote. Many men believed<br>that it was not necessary for women to vote, because they assumed that the husband<br>should decide on behalf of his wife. Some men believed that women did not possess the<br>intelligence or the discipline to vote carefully. Some women also believed that women<br>should not be involved in politics, but many others wanted the right to vote.<br>By about the year 1850, some women began to organize in an effort to change the laws<br>regarding women and the vote. This movement was known as the @x@woman suffrage@x@<br>movement, because the word @x@suffrage@x@ means voting. Leaders such as Susan B.<br>Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton brought attention to this issue, and persuaded<br>many people that women should vote.<br>The first part of the United States to recognize women's right to vote was Wyoming, in<br>the year 1869. During the following decades, many other states recognized women's right<br>to vote, particularly in the western part of the country, where women had a high social<br>status. However, the United States was not the first country to recognize women's right<br>to vote at the national level.<br>The first country to recognize women's right to vote was New Zealand, in 1893. Soon<br>after, Australia also allowed women to vote, and so did the Scandinavian countries of<br>northern Europe. But in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Great Britain,<br>women could not yet vote. Women in those countries struggled to gain the vote. For<br>example, in Great Britain, Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters participated in hunger<br>strikes.<br>During World War One (1914-1918), women's work efforts were very important to winning<br>the war, and people's attitudes were increasingly in favor of women having the right to<br>vote. Women then gained the right to vote in Canada, the United States, and Great Britain.<br>Gradually, other democracies around the world also recognized women's right to vote.<br>Today, it seems difficult to believe that women were not allowed to vote only a few<br>generations ago. But there is still progress to be made. In most countries, women are<br>under-represented among political leaders. Perhaps the day will soon come when women<br>are elected as often as men.<br>",

        Title: "Charles Dickens",
        Content:
          "Charles Dickens is considered one of the greatest writers in the history of English<br>literature. Dickens wrote his many novels during the nineteenth century, but those novels<br>remain popular even today. Literary experts admire his genius at describing the lives and<br>personalities of the many characters in his books.<br>Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812. His father was a clerk who worked for the<br>Navy. Unfortunately, his father was not good at managing money, and the family soon<br>went deeply into debt. In those days, people who owed money were sent to prison, and<br>their families were sent to places called @x@workhouses.@x@ When Charles's father was<br>unable to pay the debts, Charles was sent to a workhouse, where he had to work long<br>hours, and Charles's father was sent to prison. After a few years, the family regained its<br>freedom, but the experience had a lasting effect upon Charles.<br>As a young man, Charles Dickens worked as a journalist in the law courts and in<br>Parliament. But he soon began writing stories for newspapers. These stories were very<br>popular with the readers. Soon, Dickens began writing entire novels for the newspapers.<br>Each month, the newspaper would publish another chapter of Dickens's latest novel.<br>One of Dickens's most famous early novels is called Oliver Twist. This is the story of a<br>young man who is poor and alone in the city of London, and becomes involved in<br>criminal activities to support himself. The characters in this novel have a very wide range<br>of personalities, but seem very real to the reader. This book exposed the conditions that<br>faced the poor people of London, and helped to encourage reforms aimed at improving<br>those conditions.<br>Perhaps Dickens's most popular novel is A Christmas Carol. In this story, a rich but<br>stingy old man, Ebenezer Scrooge, refuses to give his employee a day off work at<br>Christmas, and refuses to donate money to help the poor. But, while sleeping, Scrooge is<br>visited by ghosts from his past, present and future. These ghosts show Scrooge how<br>badly he has behaved. When Scrooge wakes up, he becomes a kind and generous man<br>who fully appreciates the spirit of the Christmas holiday.<br>Another famous novel of Dickens is A Tale of Two Cities. This is a story of the violence<br>and upheaval during the French Revolution. The story is famous for the heroic act of<br>sacrifice that is made by one character for the benefit of the others.<br>Dickens was famous as a public speaker, and large crowds assembled to hear his<br>performances. When he died in 1870, he was a very famous man.<br>The novels of Charles Dickens allow the reader to experience the life of nineteenth<br>century London, showing the poverty and injustice that were so common. The characters<br>of these novels show the range of human behaviour, from cruelty and selfishness to<br>kindness and love. It is no surprise that Dickens is viewed as one of the great figures of<br>English literature.<br>",

        Content:
          "Mark Twain was the author of some of the greatest works of American English literature,<br>such as Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.<br>Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He used Mark Twain as his<br>@x@pen name@x@.<br>Samuel Clemens was born in the American state of Missouri in 1835. As a child he<br>enjoyed many outdoor activities, such as swimming and fishing. When Samuel was<br>eleven years old, his father died, and he began working to help support his family.<br>As a young man, Samuel Clemens began to write stories for newspapers. However, he<br>took a job working as a navigator on the steamboats that travelled up and down the<br>Mississippi River. Clemens greatly enjoyed this period of his life, during which time he<br>gained much knowledge about life on the river. He also learned much about human<br>behaviour by observing the many people on the boats and along the river. It was as a<br>result of this time that Clemens began using his pen name, Mark Twain. This name is<br>taken from a term that was used by the men who worked on the river. It is used to<br>describe water that is just deep enough to be navigated safely.<br>The earliest of Mark Twain's really famous novels was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.<br>This novel describes a boy who engages in much mischief, but who has a kind heart. The<br>story contains several scenes that are quite funny. In one of these, Tom is working at the<br>boring task of painting a fence. He persuades several other boys to help him, by<br>pretending that painting the fence is a fun and enjoyable activity.<br>Another famous novel by Mark Twain was Life on the Mississippi. This book describes<br>many interesting characters similar to those that Twain actually observed while working<br>on a steamboat. This story gives the reader a vivid image of the people who lived and<br>worked along the Mississippi River.<br>Probably the best novel by Mark Twain was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This<br>novel tells the story of a boy who runs away from his violent father. The boy, whose<br>name is Huckleberry Finn, is joined in his escape by a man named Jim. Jim is a slave<br>who has decided to run away from his owners. Huck and Jim travel north along the<br>Mississippi, hoping to reach the areas where slavery is not allowed. In this story, the<br>reader can experience the moral sense of Huckleberry, who must make several important<br>decisions during the escape.<br>Mark Twain died in 1910, after writing many more novels and many stories of his travels<br>around the world. Twain's works are still widely read today. His books are appreciated for<br>their humor, for their interesting descriptions of life in nineteenth century America, and<br>for showing both the good and evil that people can do. Many critics consider Twain to<br>have been the greatest American writer.<br>",

Within the Caribbean sea are many islands that have played an important role<br>in the history and culture of the Western hemisphere.<br>By far the largest island in the Caribbean is Cuba. Cuba was formerly a colony of Spain,<br>but became independent in 1902. Cuba became a Communist country in 1959, when a<br>revolution overthrew an unpopular government. After the revolution, many Cubans fled<br>to the United States. Today, the American city of Miami, in the state of Florida, has been<br>greatly influenced by Cuban culture. Tobacco is widely grown in Cuba, and the country is<br>famous for the cigars that are produced in the capital city, Havana.<br>The island of Hispaniola is located just east of Cuba. This island is divided into two<br>countries. In the west is Haiti, where the people speak a variety of the French language<br>that has been influenced by African languages. In the east is the Dominican Republic,<br>where the people speak Spanish.<br>Another important Caribbean island is Puerto Rico. This was previously a Spanish colony,<br>but it is now governed by the United States. Many people from Puerto Rico have moved<br>to the mainland United States, especially the New York area.<br>In many other islands in the Caribbean, English is the main language. The largest of<br>these islands is Jamaica, which is located just south of Cuba. Most Jamaicans are the<br>descendants of African people who were brought to work as slaves on sugar plantations.<br>Jamaica is famous as the birthplace of the style of music called @x@reggae,@x@ which was<br>popularized in other countries by Bob Marley, a famous Jamaican musician.<br>Another important English-speaking Caribbean island is Trinidad. This island is located<br>just north of South America. The population of Trinidad is very diverse. The largest<br>groups of people are descended from people who came from Africa and India, but there<br>are many other nationalities also. Trinidad is famous for a style of music known as<br>@x@calypso,@x@ and for musicians who produce pleasant sounds by playing steel drums.<br>There are also many other, smaller islands in the Caribbean, each with its own unique<br>features. Many of these islands possess fine beaches, and are popular tourist<br>destinations.

But when the first<br>Europeans came to North America, they mistakenly believed that they had reached India,<br>so they referred to the people as Indians. In different parts of North America, the Indians<br>had very different cultures and very different ways of making a living.<br>On the west coast of North America, many large rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean. In<br>these rivers is an abundance of fish, such as salmon. The Indians in these areas<br>obtained much of their food by fishing. They lived in settled villages, and became experts<br>in carving wood from the tall trees of the area. They carved large canoes for traveling on<br>the rivers and oceans, and they also carved tall @x@totem poles.@x@ Totem poles were<br>carvings of various animal or human figures, and often the poles had a mythical or<br>spiritual significance for the people who carved them. Many beautiful totem poles can be<br>seen in cities such as Vancouver or Victoria, in the Canadian state of British Columbia; or<br>Seattle, in the American state of Washington.<br>The Plains Indians lived in the central prairie of North America. The various nations of<br>the Plains lived by hunting large animals called buffalo, or bison. Horses were brought to<br>North America in the sixteenth century by the Spanish. The Indians who lived in the<br>prairie areas had learned to become experts at riding horses, and on horseback they<br>could hunt the giant herds of bison. They followed the buffalo from place to place. The<br>Plains Indians lived in portable houses called @x@teepees,@x@ which were made by sewing<br>together buffalo skins, and holding them in place with wooden poles.<br>In the southwestern United States, some Indians lived by farming. In this dry area, the<br>Indians raised several crops, such as corn, beans, and squash. Many of the Indians in<br>these areas lived in large settlements, where the houses were made from stone or dried<br>mud. The people were experts at weaving, and they made clothing and blankets that had<br>beautiful artistic designs.<br>Near the eastern coast of North America, many Indians lived by a combination of farming<br>and hunting. These people lived in fortified villages, some of which were inhabited for<br>many years at a time. In some places, they built large earthworks that can still be seen<br>today.<br>In the forests of northern Canada, the Indians lived primarily by hunting, fishing, and<br>gathering. Like the Indians of the prairie regions, they often moved from place to place in<br>search of game animals to hunt.<br>Today, the Indians of North America no longer live in their traditional ways. However,<br>several Indian languages are still spoken by many thousands of people. Also, many<br>Indians in the United States and Canada are very interested in maintaining the cultural<br>traditions of their ancestors.<br>",

These great musicians were Mozart and<br>Beethoven.<br>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Austria in the year 1756. As a child, Mozart was a<br>musical prodigy. He began composing music before his fifth birthday, and by the time he<br>reached his teenage years, Mozart had already written many symphonies and other<br>musical works.<br>As a young man, Mozart worked as a @x@concert-master@x@ for the Archbishop of Salzburg, in<br>Austria. He also travelled to various European cities. When he was in his mid-twenties,<br>Mozart moved to the city of Vienna. Mozart had difficulty earning a living, but during this<br>time he wrote some excellent operas and string quartets. Many people did not yet<br>appreciate the greatness of Mozart's music.<br>In his early thirties, Mozart became the court musician for the Emperor of Austria, and<br>during the next few years Mozart continued to write many beautiful works of music.<br>Mozart died in 1791, but although his life was short, his productivity had been enormous.<br>The beauty, grace, and technical precision of his music is still greatly admired, and he is<br>considered one of the greatest musicians of all time.<br>When Mozart was in Vienna, he met a young musician named Ludwig van Beethoven.<br>Beethoven performed some music for Mozart, who was greatly impressed by the talent of<br>this young man. Beethoven had been born in Germany in 1770, and from an early age he<br>had displayed a great aptitude for music.<br>Beethoven moved permanently to Vienna in 1792. He studied music under some famous<br>composers, and became known for his outstanding skill in playing the piano. Beethoven<br>began to compose more of his own music, and these works became very popular. When<br>in his late twenties, Beethoven began to lose his hearing. He continued to compose<br>excellent music, but he became more withdrawn, and performed less frequently.<br>By the year 1817, Beethoven had become completely deaf, and he could no longer<br>perform music.

It was Beethoven's influence<br>that began the @x@Romantic@x@ era of music, which followed the @x@classical@x@ era of the<br>nineteenth century. Beethoven died in 1827, but his music remains famous for its beauty<br>and originality. His greatest symphonies, such as the Fifth Symphony, are among the<br>world's best-known works of music.<br>Today, the works of Mozart and Beethoven are still popular among those who appreciate<br>great music.

After<br>graduating from high school, Earhart studied to become a nurse. She worked as a<br>military nurse in Canada during World War One, treating injured soldiers. After the war,<br>she returned to the United States, and became a social worker. But in 1920 she saw<br>airplanes in a stunt-flying exhibition, and early the next year she took her first ride in an<br>airplane. It was then that Amelia Earhart decided to become a pilot.<br>Within a few months, Earhart saved her money and bought a small airplane. She flew<br>frequently, and improved her skills as a pilot. In 1928, she joined two men in a flight<br>across the Atlantic Ocean.<br>But Amelia Earhart's greatest exploits were still to come. In May 1932, she attempted to<br>become the first woman to fly @x@solo,@x@ or alone, across the Atlantic Ocean. She flew east<br>from the island of Newfoundland, and faced cold weather, high winds, and dense fog. But<br>she successfully crossed the ocean, and landed her airplane in a farmer's field in Ireland.<br>When news of her flight reached the United States, Amelia Earhart had become very<br>famous.<br>Later flights by Amelia Earhart were equally impressive. She became the first person to<br>fly from Hawaii to California, across 4000 kilometres of the Pacific Ocean. She also<br>became the first person to fly from Mexico City to the New York City area. But in 1937,<br>she planned her most ambitious flight: a journey around the world.<br>On June 1st, 1937, Amelia Earhart took off from Miami, Florida. She was accompanied by<br>her navigator, Fred Noonan. They flew east, making stops along the way. Within one<br>month, they had flown across three-quarters of the globe, reaching the Pacific island of<br>New Guinea. On July 2nd, Earhart and Noonan took off from New Guinea, flying toward<br>Howland Island. This very small island was over 4000 kilometres from New Guinea, and<br>was very difficult to find in the middle of the vast ocean.<br>During this flight, Earhart and Noonan were in radio contact with some ships from the<br>U.S. Navy. However, bad weather made it impossible to see the stars at night, so<br>navigation was very difficult, and the plane became lost. Earhart and Noonan never<br>arrived at Howland Island. The U.S. Navy undertook a massive search, but they never<br>found the lost airplane. Earhart and Noonan had been lost at sea.<br>Amelia Earhart's death was a great tragedy, but she had lived an exciting life that was full<br>of achievements. She had helped to show that very long flights could be made, and that<br>women could perform feats of flying that were equal to those of men. Even today, many<br>people are inspired by the courage and endurance of Amelia Earhart.<br>",

In the Province of<br>Ontario there is Grade 13, which is a required step for all students who want to attend a<br>degree-granting university.

However, it is<br>not able to grant university degrees alone, although it often offers all the courses<br>required for a university degree. The curriculum for a degree program is usually<br>designed in conjunction with a university, which actually grants degrees to the university<br>college students.<br>",

The most important functional areas of business include: accounting,<br>finance, marketing, production/operations, and human resources management.<br>Accounting is a field of business that records and reports the flow of funds through a<br>firm on a historical basis and produces important financial statements such as balance<br>sheets and income statements. It also produces forecasts of future conditions such as<br>projected financial statements and financial budgets, and evaluates the firm's financial<br>performance against the forecasts.<br>The finance area of business supports a firm in decisions concerning the financing of the<br>firm's business and the allocation and control of financial resources within the firm.<br>Major activities of finance include cash and investment management, capital budgeting,<br>financial forecasting, and financial planning. The cash and investment management<br>activities forecast and manage the firm's cash position and short-term and other<br>securities.

          "Electronic commerce (or simply e-commerce) is more than just buying and selling<br>products or services online. It encompasses the entire online process of developing,<br>marketing, selling, delivering, servicing, and paying for products and services. E-<br>commerce systems rely on the resources of the Internet and other computer networks to<br>support every step of the process. Through an e-commerce system, customers can order<br>and make payment for the products or services they purchase online and receive support<br>at the company's websites through the Internet. It also allows customers and suppliers to<br>participate in product development via Internet newsgroups and E-mail exchanges. There<br>are three basic types of e-commerce applications: business-to-business (B2B), business-<br>to-consumer (B2C), and consumer-to-consumer (C2C).<br>Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce is the online automation of purchase and sale<br>transactions from business to business. Many companies use secure Internet or<br>extranets for their business customers and suppliers to access to their websites while<br>some may rely on electronic data interchange (EDI) systems. Cisco Systems, a leading<br>manufacturer of computer networking equipment, makes about 40 percent of its sales<br>online. These activities include order taking, credit check, production scheduling and<br>technical support to their customers. General Electric and the United Parcel Service<br>(UPS) are a few of many other firms that offer B2B e-commerce sites.<br>Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce creates electronic marketplaces where<br>businesses promote and sell products and services directly to consumers. In this form of<br>electronic commerce, which has grown into a multibillion dollar market, businesses can<br>bypass intermediaries such as distributors or retail outlets. Companies like Amazon.com<br>and Dell Corporation offer e-commerce websites that provide virtual storefronts and<br>multimedia catalogs, interactive order processing, secure electronic payment systems,<br>and online customer support.<br>Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce is an important alternative for business-to-<br>business or business-to-consumer e-commerce. In this form of e-commerce, consumers<br>can buy and sell products and services with each other in an auction process at an<br>auction website. Through an online auction site like e-Bay, one of the most successful<br>C2C e-commerce models, consumers or businesses can participate in or sponsor<br>consumer or business auctions. Other forms of consumer-to-consumer e-commerce<br>include personal advertising of products or services by consumers at electronic<br>newspaper sites, consumer e-commerce portals, or personal websites.<br>",

          "I left Korea 25 years ago for Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I was 17 years old at that time.<br>Now everyone knows how old I am. As any immigrant who left his or her own country for<br>a new place looking for a better life, I believe the first five years of my living in Canada<br>were the most challenging ones.<br>It did not take long time for me to realize that I would have to face one of the biggest<br>challenges in my life: the language problem. Although I had learned English in high<br>schools for almost for five years before coming to Canada, I did not find it useful in day-<br>to-day living at this new place. My frustrations, stemming from lack of my English<br>conversation skills, included ordering food at a fast-food restaurant, phone conversation,<br>and conversations with neighbors.<br>The most frustrating moment was my inability to explain to other people when I was<br>accused of something I did not do. Knowing that I was not able to defend myself properly<br>due to lack of conversation skills, a few people often took advantage of me for their own<br>benefits.<br>However, throughout the years I met a lot of good people who gave me strength and<br>encouragement. Among those people in my heart I still remember Mrs. Overholts. Mrs.<br>Overholts was working in the Counsellor's Office at the high school I attended for two<br>years, and she gave me a lot of valued advice and directions in regards to my academic<br>life, as well as my personal one.<br>My dear friends in my high school also helped me not only to survive in the new country<br>but also taught me the new cultures and systems. Some of them went to the same<br>university as I did, while others went to different institutions. I am still in contact with<br>many of them, but wherever they are I believe they are making a positive contribution to<br>the society.<br>I owe the most to my father; my mother, who passed away seven years ago; and my<br>brothers. We were neither rich nor poor, but we stuck together all the time. My parents<br>taught me love, care, and kindness through their actions, not just their words. It was<br>from my family that I got strength when I was weak. It was my family who listened to me<br>when I needed to talk. It was my family who really was happy for me when I told them<br>good news.<br>The first five years of my life in Canada surely was one of the most difficult times in my<br>life. I believe, however, that it was also an important time period in my life for me to<br>become a more mature and independent human being. I thank all of those who played a<br>role in some way to help me out during the transition period of my life.<br>",

The purpose of Sport Canada is to develop and encourage sport, health, and<br>exercise programs for all Canadians. However, Sport Canada's main emphasis is on<br>high-performance athletes training for major international athletic competitions, such as<br>the Olympic Games.<br>Sport Canada was created in the 1970s as a response to the perceived need to help<br>athletes train and compete in international sport. Before the 1970s, athletes wishing to<br>train and compete in sport had to support themselves financially. Athletes were either<br>independently wealthy, or were supported by family or friends. Unfortunately, many high-<br>caliber athletes without such financial support simply could not afford to train and<br>compete in international competition.<br>Also, before the early 1970s almost all international sports events were amateur. Amateur<br>rules meant those receiving funds from government programs or corporations were<br>breaking the rules of sport. Athletes receiving money were disqualified from competition.<br>As a result, the amateur rules generally limited training and competition to those athletes<br>who came from wealthier families. Less fortunate athletes, many of whom likely would<br>have performed well for Canada in international competitions, simply could not afford to<br>do so.<br>Sport Canada has been a role model for many government-run sport programs around<br>the world. With its central administrative offices in Canada's capital of Ottawa, Sport<br>Canada efficiently provides administrative, coaching, and financial help for athletes<br>across the country. Athletes can concentrate their efforts full-time on training and<br>competition. As a result, Canada's share of the medal totals in the Olympic Games has<br>risen since the 1970s.<br>Recently, Sport Canada's programs have been criticized by some who feel that the<br>program does not provide enough money for athletes. While it does provide financial<br>assistance to athletes, the amount paid is well below Canada's minimum wage. Critics<br>point out that athletes work full-time and perform an important function for the Canadian<br>government and people. As a result of this criticism, the Canadian government has<br>provided more money for athletes. However, the amount is still below the minimum wage<br>level. As a result, the amount paid to athletes is likely to rise in the future.<br>As long as it effectively manages problems such as funding, Sport Canada will continue<br>to provide the Canadian public with international-caliber athletes who compete with the<br>very best in the world.<br>",

Leagues competed vigorously for the best players in order to be<br>successful and attract spectators and fans. While this was beneficial to players because<br>they could command higher salaries, it was bad for business because owners' expenses<br>skyrocketed. As a result, many teams and leagues went bankrupt.<br>By the 1930s, however, the NHL remained as the only major professional league in North<br>America. This effectively kept players' salaries down and reduced expenses. The NHL's<br>team owners realized that in order for the league to be a successful commercial business,<br>they would have to stop competing against each other off the ice. This was best<br>accomplished by ensuring that only one major league existed, so that competition was<br>reduced. To this day, the same business model is followed, and the NHL is still the only<br>major professional hockey league in North America.<br>For several decades in the mid-twentieth century, the NHL owners were extremely<br>successful financially. They generated very high profits because, having a monopoly on<br>in the hockey market, they could limit the sale and trade of players. When players signed<br>on to a team, they generally did so for life, and at the pay rate determined by the owner.<br>Players were forced to accept these conditions because there were no other leagues in<br>existence.<br>This all changed in the 1970s when players organized to form a players' union. Through<br>the collective bargaining process, players gradually fought owners for higher pay and<br>greater rights. Today, many players are very wealthy for this reason. If it was not for the<br>players' union, it is likely they would still be working in similar conditions to those during<br>the early days of the NHL: low pay and little freedom to move from team to team.<br>With NHL owners and players cooperating, the NHL continues to be the most successful<br>and entertaining hockey league in North America. Teams across Canada and the United<br>States compete for the prized Stanley Cup, the most sought-after trophy in North<br>American hockey.<br>",

        Content:
          "Athletes using drugs to enhance performance has become one of the greatest problems<br>facing elite international sport. Major sports organizations, such as the International<br>Olympic Committee, are putting a lot of time, effort, and money into the detection of<br>drugs. The race between athletes using drugs and detection agencies seems to be just<br>as fierce as sport competition itself.<br>Athletes have been using drugs or other stimulants to enhance performance for<br>centuries. Even athletes in the ancient Olympic Games in Greece used various<br>stimulants to enhance performance. However, since the 1950s the degree of drug use<br>has risen to a level never before seen in human athletic history.<br>Drug testing began in the Olympic Games in the 1960s. One of the first sports to<br>encounter drug use was cycling. During the 1960 Summer Olympic Games in Rome, Italy,<br>a cyclist died from amphetamine use. In 1967, another cyclist died in the Tour de France<br>cycling race. Around the same period, body-builders in the United States were<br>experimenting with newly developed synthetic steroids that built muscle mass. As a<br>result, the International Olympic Committee started testing for steroids during the 1976<br>Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada.<br>Probably the most famous case of an athlete using drugs was Canadian sprinter Ben<br>Johnson. After winning the 100-metre sprint in the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in<br>Seoul, South Korea, Johnson's drug test was found to be positive. Johnson took a<br>synthetic steroid to build muscle mass and enhance power. Eventually, Johnson was<br>stripped of his gold medal.<br>In the aftermath of Johnson's positive drug test, the Canadian government conducted a<br>federal inquiry into drug use in Canadian sport. The government inquiry was the largest<br>one to have been conducted in any country up to that point in time. The results of the<br>inquiry found that drug use among Canadian athletes was very common. The inquiry<br>stated that there were problems beyond just individual athletes, such as Johnson, taking<br>drugs to enhance performance. Indeed, it was stated that there was a moral crisis<br>throughout sport.<br>Today, the race between drug detection agencies and athletes who use drugs continues.<br>In January 2000, the International Olympic Committee created a new agency to detect<br>drug use: the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA has provided increased<br>resources for drug detection, especially in Olympic sports. Hopefully, WADA will be able<br>to keep pace with the current moral crisis in sport.<br>",

Created in 1971 by the federal<br>government, ParticipAction was successful in encouraging Canadians to be active and to<br>stay healthy.<br>ParticipAction was created by the Canadian Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre<br>Trudeau. Trudeau believed that sport and recreation should play an important role in the<br>lives of Canadian citizens. His government took two steps towards the accomplishment<br>of this goal. First, a government agency was created to provide funds for high<br>performance athletes, such as those training and competing in the Olympic Games. A<br>second agency was created to encourage participation and physical activity in the<br>general Canadian population. It was out of this second agency that ParticipAction was<br>born.<br>ParticipAction became famous in the 1970s because of a series of television<br>commercials. In these commercials, a young Canadian in his 20's was seen being out-<br>run by a 60-year old Swedish man. The message was that Canadians had become lazy<br>and inactive. This was probably true of Canadians at the time. Physical fitness was not<br>highly encouraged in schools, especially for women. Also, the government played little<br>role in encouraging physical activity before ParticipAction.<br>The result of ParticipAction was impressive. Canadians became more active in the years<br>following the program's inception. Also, fitness and activity were encouraged through<br>physical education programs. ParticipAction was seen as a positive program because it<br>got Canadians active while reducing health care costs caused by inactivity and poor<br>physical conditioning.<br>Recently, ParticipAction was terminated by the federal government because of a lack of<br>funding. Many people thought this was a shame given the positive messages the<br>program gave to otherwise inactive Canadians. Despite the program's termination,<br>ParticipAction has made a long-lasting impression on Canadians. Hopefully, its positive<br>example of physical fitness for Canadians will continue in the future.<br>",

          "The modern Olympic Games began in the late-nineteenth century as a revival of the<br>ancient Greek Olympics. Now just over one hundred years old, the modern Olympic<br>movement is the biggest and most important sports movement in the world. In fact, many<br>people believe the Olympic Games to be the most important cultural event of any kind in<br>the world.<br>The modern Olympic Games were the brainchild of Frenchman Baron Pierre de<br>Coubertin. De Coubertin's dream for an international sports event and cultural movement<br>became a reality in 1894 at the International Athletic Congress in Paris. After the Games<br>were constituted in 1894, the first Olympic Games was held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, in<br>recognition of the ancient Greek Olympic Games.<br>The original purpose of the Olympic Games in de Coubertin's mind was to celebrate and<br>strengthen the physical, mental, and cultural qualities of humanity. The Games would<br>blend sport with culture, tradition, and education. The philosophy of Olympism is based<br>on the joy of physical and mental effort and the respect for universal ethical principles.<br>De Coubertin envisioned creating a more noble and sympathetic humanity through the<br>Olympic movement.<br>The sports events themselves de Coubertin modeled after the English public school<br>sport system. He saw in upper-class English boys' sport the qualities of camaraderie,<br>nobility, and honesty. Most importantly, however, was adherence to the rules of sport, in<br>particular the rule that stated sport ought to be amateur in nature. De Coubertin believed<br>participants should never participate in sport for the purpose of making money. To do so<br>would contradict the underlying philosophy of sport. Breaking the amateur rule in de<br>Coubertin's time was as serious a violation as taking drugs to enhance performance is in<br>today's world of sport.<br>Over time, the Olympics grew to be the largest international festival of any kind. Today,<br>debates exist as to the degree to which the modern Games adhere to de Coubertin's<br>original intent. On the one hand, Olympic sport is truly international in nature, as de<br>Coubertin would have wanted it. On the other hand, it is doubtful that de Coubertin would<br>have admired the existence of politics, commercialism, and drug use in sport. The<br>Olympics have become truly international, but perhaps at a price.<br>There is little question that the Olympic Games hold out the possibility for fulfilling de<br>Coubertin's original goal of sport contributing to a better, more peaceful, and<br>understanding world.<br>",

          "There is a long and rich history of sport participation in Canada. Many of the sports and<br>games Canadians currently play can be traced back to the early days of Canadian history.<br>In the nineteenth century, sport and games in Canada were not highly organized. Few<br>people had the time or money for playing games. The harsher aspects of everyday life<br>took precedence. However, around the turn of the century, several amateur sport<br>organizations emerged. These groups attempted to organize sports competitions, set<br>rules, and develop teams and leagues. As a result, organized competitions quickly grew<br>in number around this period in time, especially in the 50-year period between 1870 and<br>1920.<br>Some of the earliest organized sports in Canada were rifle shooting, rowing, track and<br>field, rugby football, skating, cricket, and golf, among others. Many of these sports were<br>imports of sporting traditions from Great Britain. This made sense given that many of the<br>leaders of early amateur sports organizations were recent British immigrants to Canada.<br>An example of early Canadian sport can be seen in the sport of rowing. Imported from<br>the rowing traditions in England, rowing was one of the most famous sports in early<br>Canadian history. Although relatively few Canadians actually rowed themselves, many<br>participated as spectators. Rowing races between Canadian oarsmen and between<br>Canadians and international competitors were famous events. Also, gambling or betting<br>on the outcome of races attracted many spectators.<br>The most famous Canadian athlete of the times was Ned Hanlan (1855-1908). An oarsman,<br>Hanlan remains to this day one of the most famous athletes in Canadian history. In fact,<br>during his life he was famous throughout the world. A Canadian and world champion<br>several times over, Hanlan was a fierce competitor. However, Hanlan was also famous for<br>his appeal to spectators. He made a regular practice of gaining a seemingly<br>insurmountable lead over his rival and then stopping to wave at the crowds on the<br>shoreline. He would even slow down during a race, allowing his competition to catch up<br>to him, only to take the win at the last moment. These exploits made Hanlan one of the<br>first showmen in sport; he recognized the importance of the entertainment value of sport.<br>Sport in Canada has developed rapidly since Hanlan's time. Today, Canada has a<br>complex system of amateur sports organizations and professional leagues. In addition,<br>in the 1960s the federal government of Canada became directly involved in the pursuit of<br>healthy lifestyles and sporting traditions of Canadians. Today, the government provides<br>funds for elite amateur athletes preparing for World Championships and the Olympic<br>Games. The athletic role models produced by these government programs are crucial to<br>Canadians in general.<br>",

          "Canada is a relatively young country, existing as a separate national and political entity<br>only since 1867. As a result, its sporting traditions are relatively young as well. Most of<br>the professional teams and leagues in Canada developed only in the last 30 years or so.<br>However, athletes playing their respective sports for money dates back to the late-<br>nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br>Canada has six National Hockey League (NHL) teams, eight Canadian Football League<br>(CFL) clubs, two Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs, and one National Basketball<br>Association (NBA) team. There are also smaller professional soccer and lacrosse<br>leagues in Canada. It is estimated that professional sports and leagues throughout the<br>country contribute over $600 million in value to the country's economy, and account for<br>over 23,000 jobs.<br>Of the professional sports, hockey has the longest history and the greatest cultural<br>influence on Canadians. The NHL has been in existence since 1917; however, organized<br>professional and amateur leagues existed in Canada long before then. Many small-town<br>teams competed for local or provincial championships, and had a strong influence on<br>those Canadians who had little access to, or knowledge of, big-city teams in Toronto or<br>Montreal. In fact, it was not until NHL games were broadcast on the Canadian national<br>radio @x@Hockey Night in Canada@x@ radio broadcasts that many Canadians had experienced<br>an NHL game. Indeed, despite the fact that the NHL was considered Canada's most<br>prestigious league, it was not until the advent of television in the 1950s that most<br>Canadians had even seen an NHL game.<br>Today, all professional sport in Canada is in one way or another affected by the more<br>powerful American leagues. In the sports of baseball and basketball, Canada has no<br>professional leagues of its own. Instead, Canadian teams play in the American-<br>dominated leagues. These leagues require a large concentrated audience in order to<br>generate revenues for the team and, in turn, the league in general. As a result, the major<br>team franchises exist in the large urban centres: Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Even<br>between those cities, the teams are not evenly spread. Probably the most famous teams<br>in the American-dominated leagues are both Toronto teams: the @x@Blue Jays@x@ in Major<br>League Baseball and the @x@Raptors@x@ in the National Basketball Association.<br>Many Canadians worry that the American dominance of professional sport is a threat to<br>Canadian independence. As an important component of national culture, sport reflects<br>and reinforces the norms and values of Canada. However, the most sought-after and<br>visible teams in Canada are ones in American-dominated leagues. Even the National<br>Hockey League-once considered a secure Canadian sports icon-has its corporate offices<br>in New York. Debates about the threat of American-dominated professional sport to<br>Canadian sovereignty will undoubtedly continue in the future.<br>",

In fact, Hanlan was a regular winner of World Championship titles.<br>Part of the popularity of rowing involved gambling and lucrative prizes. Spectators<br>regularly bet on single sculling, in much the same way they do on horse racing today.<br>Hanlan quickly rose to fame in the late-nineteenth century through a combination of<br>careful financial planning of his athletic career and his mastery of the sport. Perhaps his<br>most ingenious invention was the now-common @x@sliding seat.@x@ By fixing wheels onto a<br>wooden seat, Hanlan gained an advantage over his competitors, who slid back and forth<br>in the boat on grease.

He was even known to fake an injury in the middle of a<br>race, only to recover just in time to win the race.

He also competed in commercial exhibitions and rowing<br>tours around the world. After his competitive career ended, Hanlan went on to coach<br>younger oarsmen in two North American universities: Toronto and Columbia.

The<br>modern version of the sport was developed mainly in England in the nineteenth century,<br>especially in the public school system. However, boat races somewhat similar to the<br>modern sport took place in ancient Greece during the ancient version of the Olympics.<br>In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, rowing gained much popularity. The<br>sport was particularly famous in countries with a history of immigration from Great<br>Britain: Canada, Australia, and the U.S.A. Most of the main colonial countries had<br>national championships, and a world championship was regularly held. The sport<br>developed either in private clubs or in elite educational institutions. In 1852, a race<br>between Yale and Harvard universities in the U.S. was the first organized athletic<br>competition of any kind.<br>The turn of the century saw the sport's ascendancy to one of the largest spectator sports.<br>Many regularly held races depended on betting or gambling to attract spectators. The<br>biggest international matches attracted thousands of spectators, and much money was<br>wagered. Canadian Ned Hanlan was perhaps the greatest of the early rowing champions.<br>In the late nineteenth century he dominated international rowing races. Hanlan also<br>combined his rowing skill and prowess with his own unique brand of showmanship to<br>attract spectators. Hanlan is also known for having invented the @x@sliding seat.@x@ His<br>wooden seat set on wheels greatly increased his efficiency and speed and gave him a<br>distinct advantage over competitors. Before Hanlan's time, rowers would wipe grease on<br>a wooden platform in the boat and slide over the grease. The older technique was less<br>reliable and did not allow as much leg drive as Hanlan's newly invented seat.<br>As the twentieth-century unfolded, rowing lost some of its earlier public support and<br>distinction. In North America, as professional sports attracted the attention of spectators<br>and television viewers, other amateur sporting traditions, such as rowing, lost support.<br>Today, rowing maintains a strong tradition under the administration of the world<br>governing body for the sport.

Not only was Woods the youngest ever to perform the feat, Woods' score of<br>270 set a record for the tournament. His victory was also seen by many as a symbolic<br>victory over years of racism in the sport of golf, and U.S. society in general. Woods'<br>victory in 1997 came just two days after the fiftieth anniversary of the day American<br>baseball players broke the colour barrier in professional baseball. Also, Woods' victory<br>came in a sport long recognized for racial exclusion. The Augusta National Golf Club<br>excluded blacks from playing in the Masters tournament until 1975, and the Professional<br>Golfers Association only removed its @x@Caucasians only@x@ rule in 1961.<br>Woods was born in the state of Florida in 1975. He rose to fame quickly, winning the US<br>amateur tournament from 1994-96, National Collegiate Athletic Association champion in<br>1996, and US Junior championship from 1991-1993. In the first year that Woods turned<br>professional, it is estimated that over $650 million (U.S.) in extra revenue was generated<br>in golf. Television ratings soared in the sport, and the Professional Golfers Association<br>negotiated huge contracts with American television networks as a result of Woods' fame.<br>Woods has also negotiated record-breaking private sponsorship deals with major firms<br>such as Nike, Buick, Titleist, American Express, and many others. In fact, Woods<br>negotiated deals in the millions even before he turned professional. Truly an international<br>sports celebrity, Woods sees himself as someone destined not only to be a great athlete,<br>but also a person who will have some significant social or political impact on the world. It<br>is not clear, however, what that impact will be. But there is little question that he will be<br>one of the, if not the, richest athletes in history. Woods is destined not just to be a multi-<br>millionaire, but a billionaire.<br>Heralded by some as the first black champion in a traditionally racially secluded sport,<br>he has also been received more cautiously by those who see the limitations of using<br>black sports stars as role models for youth. Only a tiny fraction of African Americans<br>have even a remote chance of becoming sports stars in any sport, especially golf. The<br>odds, in fact, are so small that there is a much greater chance of winning a lottery.<br>However, by some accounts as many as 80% of African American youth aspire to make a<br>living from playing sports. Meanwhile, 45% of African American children live below the<br>poverty line in the U.S.<br>If the trajectory of Woods' career continue on its current path, it is possible he will satisfy<br>his father's wishes for Tiger: @x@to make an impact on the world. . .it will be spiritual and<br>humanitarian and will transcend the world of golf.@x@<br>",

Mass communications and<br>transportation technology, in addition to the rise of transnational corporate culture, have<br>combined to produce a new global culture.<br>At the same time, sport has become one of the most recognized elements of global<br>culture. In fact, it has been claimed that there are no other events in the world that attract<br>the attention of more people around the world than sports events, especially the Olympic<br>Games and the World Cup football (soccer) tournament. It is difficult to think of other<br>events that attract the world's attention in the same manner as sport.<br>Global themes infuse international sporting events in several ways. One of those ways is<br>in advertising. Major transnational corporations using major events like the Olympic<br>Games advertise with global themes and images. In addition, media coverage of major<br>events often emphasizes national and international themes. These themes can be both<br>positive and negative. For example, sport can reinforce international cooperation and<br>cultural learning, but it can also be used to reinforce themes of aggressive nationalism<br>and create tension between countries. This was clearly the case during the Cold War<br>from World War II to the late-1980s, in which West Bloc and East Bloc nations regularly<br>did battle at the Olympic Games.<br>More recently, additional global themes have appeared. The international immigration<br>and movement of athletes is one theme. Increasingly, professional and elite amateur<br>athletes are attracted to other. Football (soccer) is one sport that practices @x@athlete<br>immigration@x@ frequently. Many professional teams in Europe, for example, have many<br>players from outside the team's nation.<br>An additional global theme that has appeared lately is sport used for international<br>advertising and marketing. Sport provides a very useful device for transnational<br>marketing and advertising because the symbols provided by sport are often recognizable<br>internationally, and sport provides many of the themes and images important to<br>advertising: speed, strength, competition, perseverance, and so forth. Major<br>corporations such as IBM and Coca-Cola regularly use sport to advertise their products,<br>even though these corporations don't sell sport-related products directly.<br>Some critics have claimed that major international events such as the Olympic Games<br>are being used less for international understanding and culture sharing as they are for<br>making big corporations a lot of money. While it is clear that the sport-related images<br>and symbols used by these corporations are recognized worldwide, it is not so clear<br>what positive benefits are accrued from this. In any case, there is little doubt that sport<br>will continue to play a vital role in the globalization process.<br>",

Some sports, such as football or boxing, encourage very little female<br>participation, although even these so-called @x@masculine@x@ sports are changing. Women's<br>boxing, for example, will probably be included in the Olympic Games by the end of this<br>decade.<br>In the late 1800s and early 1900s, when sports and physical education programs were<br>first organized in North America, women were forbidden from participating for so-called<br>@x@scientific@x@ or @x@medical@x@ reasons. Physicians as a group often spoke out against female<br>athleticism, using the argument that physical activity would damage reproduction.<br>Others claimed that it was quite simply @x@unnatural@x@ for women to participate in sports.<br>Little real evidence was provided to support these claims. In truth, the so-called<br>@x@evidence@x@ was more a reflection of physicians' cultural assumptions about women's<br>place in society in general.<br>The 1920s and 1930s witnessed a short @x@Golden Age@x@ in women's sports. Individual<br>athletes and teams or leagues formed to support female athletics. Track and field, tennis,<br>softball, programs in physical education, and other activities were encouraged, at least<br>for those women lucky enough to have the time and money to participate. There was<br>even a Women's Olympic Games movement in the 1920s and 1930s. At one point, the<br>regular Olympic Games organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), became<br>concerned that the Women's Olympics would gain enough power to challenge the<br>superiority of the IOC's Olympics. As a result, the IOC included a few more women's<br>events in their Games, although not many.<br>The Golden Age of women's sports was followed by a long drought. The post-World War<br>II era was one of very conservative traditional family values in North America. However,<br>in the 1970s the current boom in women's sport began. One of the driving forces in the<br>movement was East Bloc countries, particularly the Soviet Union and East Germany,<br>both of which encouraged female athletes at the highest level-the Olympic Games.<br>Female athletes with strong and muscular bodies emerged on the international sports<br>stage. At first, this raised concern among the male-dominated sports establishment.<br>However, after years of struggle, the muscular and strong female athletic body has<br>become common in international sport.<br>In the late-nineteenth century, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de<br>Coubertin, said that the sight of women participating in sport was an affront to the<br>human eye, and unnatural.

          "There is little question that television has radically changed the sporting world.<br>Television has done more than just make existing sports more accessible to a mass<br>audience. It has been argued that the very nature of sport and spectators' experiences of<br>sport has been shaped by the medium of television.<br>The first televised sporting event took place on May 17, 1939. A baseball game between<br>two American schools-Princeton and Columbia-marked the beginning of a new era in<br>sport. The first broadcast, however, was not of particularly high quality. Viewers could<br>hardly see the players on the television screen, the technology at the time being of very<br>low quality. In addition, very few people owned television sets at the time. Only 400 TV<br>sets were in circulation, and the average cost of $600 made owning a set impossible for<br>most people.<br>This situation would soon change. Television as a popular and affordable medium grew<br>rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s. By the end of the 1950s, American televised sport entered<br>a @x@Golden Age.@x@ It was during this period of time that major sporting organizations, such<br>as professional leagues, and major amateur organizations, such as the International<br>Olympic Committee (IOC), realized the benefits of television. Not only could TV make<br>competitions available for a huge number of spectators, it could actually make money for<br>these organizations. Television companies, in turn, could make money by attracting<br>viewers and selling advertising space at increased rates. Television and sport entered<br>what some observers call a @x@symbiotic@x@ or mutually beneficial relationship.<br>The business relationship developed between the American TV company ABC and the<br>Olympic Games is a clear example of the TV-sport symbiosis. In the 1960s and 1970s,<br>ABC recognized the importance of using international sport to attract viewers. By being<br>recognized as @x@The Olympic Network,@x@ ABC quickly rose from being the third biggest<br>commercial network in the U.S. to being the leading network. At the same time, ABC paid<br>higher and higher @x@rights fees@x@ to the IOC, and the IOC, in turn, began to take a more<br>commercial and professional approach to the Olympic Games. The ABC role model has<br>paved the way for other television networks around the world. Today, television rights<br>pay for the majority of Olympic Games expenses.<br>The television and sport relationship has come a long way since the first<br>Princeton/Columbia baseball game. Today, more people experience sport as spectators<br>through the medium of television than they do as regular participants in sport. The<br>television and sport relationship, then, presents a bit of a paradox. While on the one hand<br>it has made sport more visible for more people, it has perhaps done so at the expense of<br>actual participation in sport.<br>",

Starting in 1964 as a sport shoe<br>outlet, the company grew to become the market leader in footwear and apparel. Nike has<br>since diversified into a range of activities, including sports event promotion.<br>Owned by Phil Knight, Nike has become synonymous with world-class sport, especially<br>through its sponsorship of events and elite athletes such as Michael Jordan and Tiger<br>Woods. Nike is so ever-present in the sports consumers' minds, that a survey conducted<br>during the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games in 1996 revealed an extremely high<br>awareness of Nike, despite that fact that Nike was not an official sponsor of the Games.<br>Nike's success has, to a great extent, been due to the fact that the company and its<br>swoosh symbol have become ubiquitous in consumers' minds. Nike has even run<br>television commercials without even mentioning its own name, being confident enough<br>that the checkmark swoosh is more than enough to make the company known.<br>Phil Knight has been the main inspiration behind Nike and its corporate direction. A<br>competent, although not elite, middle distance runner at the University of Oregon, Knight<br>went onto Harvard business school where the Nike idea emerged out of a paper he<br>developed for a class on entrepreneurship. Knight's former coach, Bill Bowerman,<br>developed lightweight running shoes that became the new company's trademark in the<br>early days. From these modest beginnings, Nike eventually grew to become the sports<br>giant it is today.<br>Ironically, part of Nike's status in the world of competitive sports merchandising has<br>come from the attention it's received by critics. A short article published in the early-<br>1990s in Harper's Magazine quickly mushroomed into an international outcry against<br>Nike's practice of placing their factories in underdeveloped countries and paying workers<br>below-subsistence wages. Nike quickly responded to the criticisms with a number of<br>tactics to either divert attention away from the criticisms (ones that Knight, interestingly,<br>at first denied), or by acknowledging the practices but claiming Nike was @x@cleaning up its<br>act.@x@<br>In many cases, Nike has made an effort to create better working conditions for those in<br>underdeveloped countries making shoes and other merchandise. However, the overall<br>effect of Nike's changes is not known, and several groups around the world regularly<br>check, and often criticize, Nike's labour practices.<br>Nike's recent marketing extravaganzas include a $200 million (U.S.) deal with the<br>Brazilian National Soccer Federation. It has been rumoured that Knight's ego has much<br>to do with Nike's marketing strategies. Some critics have suggested that Knight's hidden<br>agenda is no less than controlling sports marketing and merchandising throughout the<br>world. Nike's corporate headquarters in Oregon reflect these aspirations. Nike's<br>buildings and surrounding grounds are constructed very much like a religious cathedral,<br>only with elite athletes, and Knight himself, as the gods.<br>",

Born in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe served in the United States Army and had a<br>good early amateur career. By the end of his life in 1993, Ashe was recognized not only<br>for his tennis, but also for his political campaigns on behalf of racial equality in the<br>United States, Haiti, and South Africa. Also, as a victim of AIDS, Ashe campaigned for<br>AIDS research near the end of his life.<br>When Ashe turned professional in 1969, he was an African American player in a sport<br>completely dominated by whites. At the peak of his career in the 1970s, Ashe won the<br>Australian Open, Wimbledon, and doubles titles at the French and Australian Opens.<br>Interestingly, Ashe encouraged young blacks not to waste their energies on sports.<br>Instead, he recommended channeling energy into academic and vocation-related studies.<br>His recommendation seems appropriate to this day. While it is the case that sports can<br>provide positive role models and encourage hard work and discipline, it is also the case<br>that many young athletes dream unrealistically of professional careers at the exclusion<br>of school. The odds of successfully making a professional league are statistically next to<br>impossible. Despite his own success, Ashe recognized this.<br>Mindful of racism in American society, Ashe always thought of his own career in terms of<br>the general experience of blacks in America. He wrote several books recounting these<br>ideas. Ashe's historical writing on the history of African Americans in sport spawned a<br>multimedia series, A Hard Road to Glory.<br>Today, while a few more blacks have been successful in sports traditionally dominated<br>by whites, it is still the case that whites dominate. The recent successes of athletes like<br>the Williams sisters in tennis and Tiger Woods in golf sometimes conceal the fact that<br>these sports are still predominantly white. According to Ashe's thinking, it would be a<br>mistake to take one role model, such as Tiger Woods, and from that conclude that race<br>problems in sport no longer exist. Like any institution, race relations in sport should be<br>thought of for their long-term trends, not individual exceptions.<br>Arthur Ashe contracted the HIV virus through a blood transfusion and died of AIDS in<br>1993, aged 50. While since his death he has become revered and respected, in the 1980s<br>near the end of his life he was unpopular for his ideas.

          "The professional career of tennis player Bjorn Borg was one of the most interesting ones<br>in recent sports history. Borg's success in his sport came at an early age. Borg won<br>Wimbledon when he was only 20 years old. However, by the time he was 26, and in the<br>prime of his career, Borg inexplicably retired from professional tennis.<br>Borg, who began playing tennis at the age of nine, was the number one ranked junior<br>player by the age of 14, and had won the Italian and French Open titles at the age of 18.<br>These were the first of several major championships won by Borg in the late-1970s and<br>early-1980s. Probably his greatest achievement was a winning streak at Wimbledon that<br>spanned five years. Between the years 1976 and 1982, Borg enjoyed almost complete<br>dominance in competitive tennis.<br>His retirement in 1983, then, was a bit of a puzzle. Although his tennis skills waned<br>somewhat in the previous year, he was still one of the top players on the tour, and only<br>26 years old. Even stranger was the fact that Borg refused to reveal the reasons for his<br>retirement.<br>Following his retirement, Borg encountered a number of personal problems, which kept<br>him in the media spotlight even though he was no longer playing competitive tennis. Five<br>years after his retirement, an emergency hospital procedure saved his life. While Borg<br>claimed he had food poisoning, it was suspected he had a barbiturate overdose. In 1991,<br>Borg attempted to make a comeback on the professional tennis tour, only to fail<br>miserably. His insistence on using a wooden racket at the time, when all of the world's<br>top players were using synthetic fiber rackets didn't help matters. At the same time,<br>Borg's second wife attempted to commit suicide, and the couple divorced in 1993.<br>Eventually, Borg disappeared into obscurity, and there is little news of his life today.<br>These sad stories about the latter part of his career aside, Borg was an important figure<br>in modern tennis history. He was the sport's first modern media star and icon. Teenage<br>girls conferred upon him a status comparable to a rock star. His face adorned t-shirts and<br>other merchandise, making him the most marketable tennis player in history. Borg's<br>career was a catalyst for Swedish tennis players. Those who followed in his footsteps<br>and held him up as their hero included tennis stars Mats Wilander and Stephan Edberg.<br>Perhaps most important of all, Borg gave to the sport of tennis a degree of showmanship,<br>visibility, and marketability that was used as a role model for the sport in future decades.<br>",

Interestingly, Didrikson would<br>always have to battle popular accounts that attacked or questioned her femininity and<br>sexuality.

          "The Dubin Inquiry was a Canadian federal government inquiry into the state of amateur<br>sport in Canada, more specifically into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by<br>Canadian athletes. The inquiry followed in the footsteps of Canadian sprinter Ben<br>Johnson's disqualification in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The inquiry was named after<br>Charles Dubin, a Canadian judge who presided over the proceedings.<br>Johnson won the Olympic men's 100-metre final in a world record time of 9.79 seconds.<br>However, his post-race mandatory drug test was positive. Johnson was found to have<br>taken the steroid Stanozolol. The subsequent stripping of Johnson's gold medal turned<br>into probably the most famous case of drug use in the history of sports. It also sent<br>shock waves rippling through the Canadian sports establishment, with various members<br>of government and the sport bureaucracy pointing fingers at each other.<br>Many observers of the sports establishment around the world followed the Dubin Inquiry<br>and the Johnson case. Several countries were dealing with the growing problem of their<br>own athletes using drugs to enhance performance, so the results of the inquiry were<br>eagerly anticipated. The inquiry heard testimony from a large number of athletes,<br>coaches, sports administrators, and others. The most interesting submissions were<br>made by Johnson's coach Charlie Francis, his physician Jamie Astaphan, and of course<br>from Johnson himself. The inquiry disclosed drug taking on a scale never before<br>suspected. It was discovered that, besides the common practice of coaches encouraging<br>athletes to take drugs, many others were guilty of turning a 'blind eye' to the problem and<br>ignoring it.<br>In the aftermath of the inquiry, a new organization, The Canadian Centre for Drug-Free<br>Sport, was created to combat the problem. This organization has taken various measures<br>in its attempt to combat drug use by Canadian athletes. However, critics of the Dubin<br>Inquiry have accused the inquiry of being little more than a government inquisition, the<br>real purpose of which was to direct attention towards individual athletes and coaches<br>and away from the government itself.<br>Increasingly in the 1980s, Sport Canada-the governing body responsible for the<br>administration of elite amateur sport in Canada-had taken a @x@success-oriented@x@ approach<br>to Canadian sport: emphasizing winning medals above all other goals. The result, critics<br>have pointed out, was to put immense pressure on Canadian athletes, leading in turn to<br>drug use--among many other extreme measures--to enhance performance. The Dubin<br>Inquiry, in other words, has had mixed reviews.<br>A further indication of the effectiveness of the Dubin Inquiry can be seen in the state of<br>Canadian sport since the inquiry. Despite attempts by The Canadian Centre for Drug-Free<br>Sport to educate athletes and coaches on the dangers of drug use, there is little doubt<br>that rampant drug use continues. This has led some observers of the Canadian sport<br>scene to claim that drug use is less a reflection of individual athletes who cheat, but<br>more a reflection of a cultural and institutional epidemic in sport. Drug use has perhaps<br>become so common in the culture of elite sport that dealing with the problem by<br>punishing individual athletes might be ineffective.<br>",

Soccer is the most widely<br>watched and played game in the world. FIFA organizes the World Cup, which takes place<br>every four years.<br>In many ways, the development of FIFA follows the organization of the sport of<br>football/soccer itself.

However, by the end of the century, FIFA had<br>affiliations in all six continents, with over 170 member countries. Alongside the<br>International Olympic Committee, FIFA is the largest sports organization in the world.<br>At the time of FIFA's creation, soccer had gained a following in several countries, in large<br>part due to British settlements. It was not until 1863 that the sports of soccer and rugby<br>were formally separated in England. While both sports were important in British culture<br>in the nineteenth century, it was soccer that took off around the world at a much more<br>accelerated rate.

There has always been a problem developing soccer in the country<br>that dominates so many other professional and amateur sports. One of the main reasons<br>for this is the country is inundated with its professional sports system.

Its first president was Dimitros Vikelas, a Greek, and its secretary<br>was Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin. De Coubertin's energy and his vision have been the<br>true inspiration behind the modern Olympic movement.<br>The IOC has effectively governed the Olympic movement for over 100 years. However,<br>that period of time has seen many conflicts and controversies within the IOC and in the<br>Olympic movement as a whole. At first, the main obstacle de Coubertin faced to creating<br>an international Olympic movement was the lack of organization of sport internationally.<br>Early sports organizations-most of them amateur-had trouble organizing their own sports<br>and leagues nationally. As a result, cooperating with the IOC internationally was an<br>extreme challenge.<br>In the early years, de Coubertin's own vision for the Games dictated much of the IOC's<br>policies and procedures. His prejudices also influenced the movement. For example, de<br>Coubertin was adamant in his rejection of female athletes' participation in the Games. An<br>embodiment of Victorian ideals and prejudices, de Coubertin thought women's place was<br>in the home, and bearing and raising children. Indeed, he thought of women's<br>competition as unnatural, immoral, and @x@indecent.@x@ As a result of de Coubertin's<br>powerful position within the IOC, it would take many years to have women participating<br>in any significant way.<br>The IOC has always claimed a @x@hands-off@x@ approach to political struggles and<br>controversies surrounding the Games. Claiming, now for over 100 years, that the IOC is<br>not a political organization, and that sport in its purest sense (one represented best by<br>the IOC, of course) is inherently nonpolitical, the IOC has always had trouble answering<br>critics who point out obvious exceptions to the claim. At the simplest level, the act of<br>competing under national flags-something the IOC encourages-is a political event. At a<br>higher political level, the Olympic Games have been used for political demonstration<br>through boycotts, and the Olympic movement was probably the most visible means of<br>symbolically fighting the Cold War.<br>The post-World War II years were lean ones for the Olympic movement. The IOC and<br>hosting cities and nations often had trouble breaking even. At its worst, the Games went<br>into great financial debt, most notoriously in the Summer Games in Montreal in 1976.<br>However, since that time, the Games have taken a more @x@market friendly@x@ approach,<br>encouraging private sponsorship and negotiating massive television contracts with<br>networks around the world, especially those in the U.S.A. As a result, the IOC is a much<br>more financially solvent organization than it was a few decades ago. However, it is not<br>clear that the IOC is following its founder's original plan for the movement. After all, de<br>Coubertin was a pure amateur at heart. The current commercially oriented Olympics<br>would make de Coubertin concerned, to say the least.<br>",

          "Michael Jordan is one of the most recognized sports figures in the world. To understand<br>the breadth of his fame, it is probably best to think of Jordan in two senses: as a person<br>and an athlete with incredible athletic prowess and skill, and as a cultural and media icon.<br>The second way of thinking about Jordan is probably equal to the first. After all, it was<br>his endorsement of dozens of commercial products, spots in movies, and in general his<br>commercially- and market-produced image that made Jordan so famous worldwide.<br>Jordan was born in 1963, one of three sons of a corporate executive. He attended North<br>Carolina University from 1981-84, and was then drafted to the National Basketball<br>Association's (NBA) Chicago Bulls. During the same year, he co-captained the U.S.A.<br>basketball team to gold in the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.<br>Jordan's fame was quickly accelerated with the help of his agent and a marketing firm.<br>After winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year distinction, Jordan quickly began signing a<br>series of marketing contracts that would eventually create the iconic image known<br>throughout the world. The most notable marketing endorsement contract came with Nike<br>Corporation. Nike built much of its marketing and commercial strategy around Jordan in<br>the 1980s and early 1990s. With his own line of Nike-produced basketball shoes and<br>clothing, Jordan established himself as a marketable commodity. The relationship<br>between Nike and Jordan would be a mutually beneficial one. It elevated Jordan to<br>international prominence, while helping push Nike to number one status as world sports<br>merchandiser.<br>Jordan's athletic status was also aided by the fact that his was a career with relatively<br>little controversy, unlike many other superstar athletes. Social and political controversies<br>surrounding Jordan were rare, and when they did occur these were minor. In 1992, he got<br>himself into a bit of trouble when he did not allow his image to be used by the NBA for<br>the licensing of leisure wear and memorabilia in the run-up to the Summer Olympic<br>Games. In addition, once at the Games, Jordan, being contractually committed to Nike,<br>refused to wear the official sponsor Reebok's warm-up suits. The issue was resolved<br>when Jordan and his teammates wore the U.S. flag and extra long lapels to cover the<br>Reebok logo.<br>In 1993, Jordan made a surprise announcement of his retirement from the NBA at the age<br>of thirty. He signed as a free agent to play Major League Baseball with the Chicago White<br>Sox, and played-unsuccessfully as it turned out-with the White Sox minor league affiliate.<br>Jordan then made a brief comeback in the NBA, only to retire soon after. History will<br>recognize Jordan not only for his athletic prowess-arguably the best the sport of<br>basketball has ever seen-and for his iconic status in the later-twentieth century world of<br>sport's marketing and image production.<br>",

          "During her competitive days, Billie Jean King was one of the most successful players in<br>women's tennis. However, King is probably more recognized for her political support of<br>women's tennis, and her fight to achieve respect for lesbian and gay athletes in tennis,<br>and in sport in general.<br>Born in Long Beach, California in 1943 as Billie Jean Moffatt, she began playing tennis at<br>the age of 11. King learned the game playing on municipal courts, rather than the route<br>most successful players take in tennis in the private clubs. When King began competing<br>in the elite levels of tennis, the sport was strictly amateur. She first entered Wimbledon in<br>1961, and only two years later she advanced to the final. She won her first Wimbledon<br>title in 1966, at the young age of 22. Her first place prize for winning was a $60 gift<br>voucher for Harrods department store. By the end of her remarkable career, King would<br>amass a remarkable 39 Grand Slam titles.<br>Although women's tennis was amateur, King and a few other players began arguing for<br>professional status. Indeed, King's competitive performances and training regimen took<br>on a very professional tone. In fact, it was King, and not men's player John McEnroe,<br>who started the practice of arguing against umpires' decisions on the court, although it<br>is the latter player who is better known for such antics. King's training and competitive<br>practices made her a truly modern and @x@professional@x@ player, but they also cost her<br>much public support.<br>King's major initiative was to start a professional tour, which began in 1968. Operating<br>outside the auspices of the @x@official@x@ tournaments and organizations, the new<br>professional tour had trouble attracting many of the top international players.<br>Interestingly, Wimbledon allowed professionals soon after King's tour started. The rest of<br>the world's tours permitted professionals soon after.<br>Among King's other major political initiatives, she aligned herself with the pro-abortion<br>movement, Title IX legislation in the U.S. (the purpose of which was to equalize girls' and<br>women's funding in education), and she negotiated a deal with the Philip Morris Tobacco<br>Company to set up the Virginia Slims tour. Finally, the famous match between herself and<br>self-styled @x@male chauvinist pig@x@ Bobby Riggs in 1973, which King won, brought much<br>public attention to King and to the growing women's athletic movement.<br>Finally, in 1981, it was revealed that King had a lesbian relationship with her secretary. At<br>first King denied the allegation, but later she admitted to the relationship. Instead of<br>hiding her sexuality, which is what female lesbian athletes had been doing for years,<br>King was the first major sports superstar to come out. As such, King will be justifiably<br>recognized as one of the first and most important fighters for the sexual rights of gays<br>and lesbians in sport.<br>",

          "Few sports events integrate the competitive side of sport with the social and playful side<br>of sport like marathon running. This might seem like a strange thing to say about what is<br>such a rigorous and physically challenging event. However, major city marathons attract<br>both serious competitors and less serious runners in the same event, and often generate<br>a citywide party atmosphere leading up to and during the event.<br>The competitive marathon was introduced as part of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.<br>The purpose of the event was to mimic the ancient Greek Games, despite the fact that no<br>such event was held in ancient Greece. However, according to legend, in 490 BC a Greek<br>soldier ran from Marathon to Athens to take news of a Greek military victory over the<br>Persians. The runner collapsed with exhaustion and died. Interestingly, the first winner of<br>the modern-day Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece, was Spiridon Louys, a Greek<br>runner.<br>As the twentieth century unfolded, major track and field meets integrated the marathon<br>into their schedules. However, the marathon grew in popularity due mostly to the<br>emergence of several urban-based marathons. Some, notably the Boston Marathon, had<br>been around for decades; however, many new ones emerged, especially in the 1970s and<br>1980s. The emergence of these popular races coincided with a late-twentieth century<br>boom in the sports and exercise industry. As a result, the sport of running took off.<br>Also, lasting images from top international competitions began to attract people to<br>marathon running. In the Olympic marathon in 1952, Emil Zatopek won the race after<br>having competed-and also won-in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres races. In 1960 and 1964,<br>Ethiopian Abebe Bikila won the marathon, making himself a national hero. Images of<br>Bikila running barefoot in his first victory in 1960 are engrained in most serious<br>marathoners' minds.<br>Women entered marathon running in the 1960s and 1970s, although their participation<br>was met with great resistance. While women had run marathons for decades (the first<br>recorded time came in 1926 by Violet Percy), it was Kathy Switzer's run in the 1967<br>Boston marathon that was one of the most important symbolic runs for women. In the<br>middle of the marathon, a Boston official spotted Switzer running and tried to yank her<br>off the course. Switzer and fellow supporters resisted, and she went on to finish the race.<br>Switzer's effort motivated other women to take on marathon running, and the<br>participation rose, although slowly. It was not until 1984 that the women's marathon was<br>included in the Olympic program.<br>Today, major city marathons in Boston, New York, London, Berlin, and cities around the<br>world make the race one of the most attractive participatory and spectator amateur<br>sports events in the world.<br>",

          "The NFL (National Football League) is one of the, wealthiest and most powerful sports<br>organizations in the world. Many of the single franchises or teams are worth $200-300<br>million each. As such, each team should be thought of as a major corporation.<br>American-style football, of which the NFL maintains a complete monopoly over the elite<br>professional ranks, has its roots in English rugby, which was played in U.S. Eastern<br>colleges and universities in the nineteenth century. However, rugby did not have features<br>in keeping with American cultural norms. So U.S. football arose out of norms consistent<br>with American society, such as clearly measured possession of territory and the<br>expansion of frontiers through conquering new land.<br>Walter Camp, a Yale player, devised the rules of the American game. In 1880, he<br>introduced @x@downs@x@ into the game, or breaks so that teams could re-assess their<br>position and prepare for the next attack. This was in stark contrast to rugby's non-stop<br>and more flowing play. This move would years later be crucial to the sport's success.<br>With natural breaks in play, the game would be one conducive to American commercial<br>television, which relies on advertisement breaks for the generation of revenue. Equally<br>important was the later inclusion of the forward pass into the game. This made the game<br>appear more offensive, and the famous @x@Hail Mary@x@ long pass is to this day one of the<br>most dramatic plays in sport.<br>Football's success as a dominant American sport (alongside baseball) was secured in<br>the 1960s with some important contracts with television networks. The ABC television<br>network sponsored a rival American Football League to compete with the other dominant<br>National Football League. ABC television did not hide the fact that the rival league was<br>created for the sole purpose of creating more leverage with advertisers. After gaining<br>greater legitimacy and earning more revenue, the up-start AFL was able to negotiate<br>independently with other television networks and sign on big-name players. The most<br>notable was star quarterback Joe Namath. With the AFL rising as a legitimate business<br>competitor, the NFL and AFL negotiated a merger, resulting in the NFL league, as it is<br>known to this day. Since the merger, the NFL has maintained almost a complete<br>monopoly over American professional football.<br>Football's success, then, has been a reflection of the ideals of American society and,<br>more specifically, of American-style commercial enterprise. The league's success has, in<br>no small part, been due to the relationship between the media and the sport. In a sense,<br>football is a perfect example of a modern media-generated sport, successfully linking<br>American norms and values with a sport tailor-made for commercial profit.<br>",

On that day, he started for the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br>The so-called @x@colour-line@x@ had existed in baseball and many other sports for decades in<br>American sports: the complete segregation of whites and blacks into separate leagues<br>and teams.<br>There had been blacks in the sport of baseball for many years. In fact, in the nineteenth<br>century blacks had played alongside whites in several leagues in the U.S. However, an<br>1896 court case reinforced the segregation baseball players according to the colour of<br>their skin. As a result, black players were excluded from major league baseball, relegated<br>either to the position of mascot for the Major League team, or forced to organize their<br>own loosely structured @x@Negro@x@ teams.<br>Robinson, the son of a sharecropper and grandson of a slave, excelled in several sports<br>before serving in the U.S. army. Initially a player in the Negro Leagues, Robinson played<br>in a period when there was increasing support for breaking down the colour barrier. The<br>Brooklyn Dodgers' manager took on Robinson mainly because Robinson was a solid<br>player, not because he was interested in challenging the colour barrier. Also, he felt it<br>would increase attendance at the Brooklyn games, especially of African American fans.<br>In 1946, Robinson went to Florida to play for the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' farm team.<br>This move was risky on Robinson's part, as racism was still rampant in the U.S.,<br>especially in the South. In Florida, there were segregation laws that prohibited blacks<br>and whites from sharing the same restaurants, hotels and other public places, including<br>the baseball field. Robinson was forced to stay in a @x@coloureds-only@x@ hotel. It was<br>believed that there would be a greater chance of Robinson being integrated into the<br>minor league in the more liberal and open environment of Canada.<br>Eventually, Robinson played his way into the Major League. However, the transition was<br>not a smooth one. In his first year, he had many pitches thrown his way and was<br>regularly taunted by fans and players. However, his season was a successful one, and he<br>was voted Rookie of the Year. Robinson's Major League career lasted 10 years. Despite<br>his initial success in breaking the colour line in baseball, it would take many decades<br>before there would be complete acceptance of black players. To this day, there is under-<br>representation of blacks in management and coaching positions in baseball.<br>Robinson died in 1972.

          "In 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX of the Educational Amendments. This<br>instituted a law that would seriously affect all U.S. educational institutions' sports<br>programs. The law specified that it was unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex in<br>any federally funded education program. This meant, among other things, that boys and<br>girls, and men's and women's sports programs would have to receive equal funding and<br>support under the new law.<br>The law was passed in a time when feminist-inspired movements in many countries<br>around the world were fighting for equality for women. While Title IX was a law directed<br>at equality in education in general, it is sports programs that received the most attention.<br>This was perhaps because of the visibility of sports and the prominent place they play,<br>especially in American post-secondary education. Initially, Title IX met with mixed<br>reviews. Especially vocal in opposition to the law were those who had a lot invested in<br>men's sports programs in the bigger educational institutions. Also, those that had<br>administered male sports programs for years felt that the changes necessary to conform<br>to Title IX's standards would be difficult and expensive.<br>In the aftermath of Title IX, a battle emerged between the National Collegiate Athletic<br>Association (NCAA) and a group that had administered women's sports, the Association<br>of Intercollegiate Athletics for Girls and Women (AIAW). The NCAA had avoided<br>equalization for years, being devoted almost exclusively to men's sport. In fact, it was in<br>opposition to the NCAA that the AIAW formed in the first place. However, with federal<br>funding now legally devoted to equalization, the NCAA made an about-turn and suddenly<br>supported equalization. In what many consider to be an obvious and unfortunate power<br>move, the NCAA absorbed the AIAW. The long-term effects of this move were to wrestle<br>control of women's sport out of the hands of women. The AIAW was administered by<br>women for women; however, with the take-over the administration of women's sport fell<br>into the hands of men.<br>Title IX did not manage to equalize funding between the sexes, at least not at first. The<br>legislators of Title IX probably couldn't imagine the resistance to equalization in sport<br>that would emerge. Nor did they probably realize the extent of male privilege in school<br>sport, especially at the upper, more elite levels. Almost thirty years after the legislation,<br>there is still not equalization in many cases, although an increasing number of schools<br>have fallen in line with the law.<br>Today, women's sport has achieved a much higher level of respectability and support in<br>schools. However, there is still resistance to complete equalization, and female-<br>supportive administrators continue to fight legal battles in support of girls' and women's<br>participation in sport.<br>",

Indeed, Simpson<br>was for a period of time probably the most talked about person in the world, but very few<br>of the discussions were about his athletic career.<br>Until his internationally famous trial, Simpson was a relative unknown outside the U.S. A<br>very wealthy and highly decorated former professional football player, Simpson made the<br>transition to acting and television commentating after his illustrious football career.<br>However, when he was charged in June of 1994 with the murder of his estranged wife<br>Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, and after his dramatic suicide getaway<br>attempt captured by television cameras, Simpson became known throughout the world<br>almost overnight.<br>Simpson was born in San Francisco in 1947 to a poor family. His father abandoned the<br>family, and it was his mother who encouraged Simpson to pursue sport, mainly to<br>compensate for some physical problems he had developed as a child.

With offers<br>from over fifty other universities to play football, Simpson went to the University of<br>Southern California. There, he played out a distinguished college career and earned<br>himself the 1968 Heisman Trophy for top college player in the U.S.<br>Simpson began his professional career by dropping out of school before graduation and<br>immediately signing a three-year endorsement deal with Chevrolet for $250,000. Drafted<br>by the Buffalo Bills in 1969, the first few years of Simpson's professional career were<br>undistinguished ones. However, from 1972 on, a new coach for the team made Simpson<br>the central figure in the team's offence. As a result, Simpson would go on to shatter<br>several running records in the National Football League. At the conclusion of his career,<br>Simpson was inducted into the Professional Football Players' Hall of Fame.<br>After his professional football career, stories about Simpson's alleged abuse of his wife<br>began circulating.

Over the next few years Nicole<br>would make thirty emergency calls to the police, none of which led to formal charges.<br>After the incidents surrounding Nicole's death and Simpson's subsequent flight from<br>police, an exhaustive months-long trial ensued, leading to Simpson's famous acquittal.<br>More than just a murder trial, however, O.J. Simpson's trial highlighted the racial<br>tensions in the U.S. In fact, history will undoubtedly remember Simpson more for his trial<br>than for his illustrious football career.<br>",

          "@x@Free agency@x@ refers to the ability of athletes to negotiate their own contracts and<br>working conditions in professional sport. Before the 1970s, most professional sports had<br>some sort of reserve system for athletes. In their reserve systems, players were forced to<br>play for a single team-usually for the duration of their careers-under the conditions set<br>by the team owner and the league bosses.<br>Historically, the sport of baseball had the most notorious reserve system, which had<br>been intact and strictly enforced for decades. The purpose of the reserve system was to<br>allow owners of professional teams to control the movement of players and reduce their<br>salaries. By being forced to play for only one team, players had little choice but to accept<br>the contractual terms and conditions set out for the player. The player, in short, did not<br>have the freedom to offer and negotiate his services on the open market, as is done on<br>all other industries. This significantly reduced owners' payroll expenses, and increased<br>profits greatly. In North America, the major professional leagues-in the sports of baseball,<br>football, hockey and basketball-all had some form of reserve system.<br>In the late-1960s and 1970s, however, the reserve system encountered a number of<br>challenges. The most important challenge came from a baseball player, Curt Flood of the<br>St. Louis Cardinals. Flood refused the terms of a trade and offered his services on the<br>open market of the Major League Baseball. When no offers were made, Flood filed suit in<br>American courts under the Sherman Antitrust Act, which makes it unlawful for any<br>business or combination of businesses to maintain a monopoly in any commercial<br>industry. While Flood did not win the case, a series of subsequent legal decisions made<br>it apparent that baseball owners had unreasonable control over their labourers-the<br>players.<br>The baseball players' union became more militant as a result of the Flood case. In 1976, a<br>court decision granted players free agency and the right to negotiate the conditions of<br>their labour services much more freely than they had in the past. The move to free<br>agency changed the character of the relations between professional sports clubs and<br>their owners.<br>Previously, owners worked or colluded together to limit the movement of players.<br>Professional sports clubs acted like a well-organized club. Free agency meant a more<br>competitive environment for players, and of course player salaries have risen<br>substantially as a result.<br>Today, sports fans often complain that players' salaries are too high. While certainly at<br>times it seems difficult to justify the huge salaries of today, it should be kept in mind that<br>before the current era of free agency and big contracts, players barely made a<br>subsistence wage, and often worked under conditions of servitude. The situation now<br>might be less than perfect; however, it's certainly a vast improvement over the pre-free<br>agency days.<br>",

The Maori came to New Zealand by boats from small Polynesian islands. They<br>arrived about 1000 years ago, and lived by farming, hunting, and fishing. About 200 years<br>ago, many more people came to New Zealand. These people were from the British Isles,<br>and they came to New Zealand to begin farms. Today, most of the people of New Zealand<br>are descended from people who came from Britain.<br>During the 19th century, some wars started between the Maori and the British settlers.<br>After years of fighting, the two sides signed a treaty to end the wars. Today the Maori<br>have achieved equal rights, but there are still some disagreements about land ownership.<br>In recent years, many more people have come to New Zealand, mostly from Asian<br>countries and from other Pacific Islands.<br>There are three large cities in New Zealand. Auckland is the largest city, with more than<br>one million people. It is located in the northern part of the North Island. The capital city of<br>New Zealand is Wellington. It is located in the southern part of the North Island. The<br>largest city of the South Island is Christchurch. The cities of New Zealand are very<br>modern and clean. Many tourists enjoy visiting the cities of New Zealand, but they also<br>enjoy the beautiful countryside. New Zealand is an excellent place for outdoor recreation,<br>such as climbing or walking.<br>Most of New Zealand has a mild, or temperate, climate. The summer is not very hot, and<br>the winter is not very cold. Because New Zealand is in the southern part of the world,<br>summer begins in December and winter begins in June. The South Island is cooler than<br>the North Island, but both islands have similar amounts of rain. This rain gives the fields<br>and forests of New Zealand a beautiful green colour. Each year, many tourists visit New<br>Zealand, to experience the beautiful countryside and the interesting cultures of its people.<br>",

        Content:
          "In many parts of the world, the sport of track and field is very popular. Actually, the sport<br>of track and field includes many different sports. In some of these sports, the athletes<br>run on a track. The athletes race against each other to find out who can run the fastest.<br>Some of these track events require great speed for a short distance. In the 100 metre race,<br>the athletes must sprint as quickly as possible. Some athletes can run 100 metres in only<br>10 seconds!<br>Other track races are much longer, and these events require great endurance. In the<br>marathon, the athletes must run a distance of 42 kilometres. Because this is such a long<br>distance, the athletes cannot run too quickly at the start. Instead, it is important to run at<br>a steady pace and keep some energy for the end of the race. Some athletes can run the<br>marathon in little more than two hours!<br>Some races are called middle distance races because the distance is not very short, yet it<br>is also not very long. For example, the 1500 metres requires a mixture of speed and<br>endurance. Some athletes can run the 1500 metres in less than four minutes! There are<br>also some track events for people who use a wheelchair. Wheelchair athletes can race<br>even faster than athletes who run!<br>Some of the races on the track are for teams of four runners. Each athlete carries a small<br>stick called a baton. After running a certain distance, the runner must hand the baton to a<br>team-mate, who then runs with the baton. To win this race, the team's runners must be<br>very fast, but they must also cooperate very well with each other.<br>In the field events, athletes compete by jumping or throwing. In the long jump, the<br>athletes run up to a line, and then try to jump as far forward as possible. In the high jump,<br>the athletes must try to jump over a very high bar. Another field event is called the shot<br>put. In this event, the athletes try to throw a heavy metal ball as far as possible. Yet<br>another field event is called the javelin throw. In this event, the athletes try to throw a<br>long spear as far as possible. Athletes who compete in the throwing events must be very<br>strong!<br>Both men and women compete in the sport of track and field. Many boys and girls enjoy<br>track and field as part of their education in school. Those boys and girls who have much<br>talent, and who work very hard, might someday compete in the Olympics. But for most<br>people, track and field is just a fun and healthy way to get exercise and to make friends.<br>",

        Content:
          "Thomas Edison was one of the most famous inventors of all time. He was born in a small<br>town in the United States during the year 1847. When he was a young boy, Thomas found<br>school to be very boring. A teacher once told Thomas's mother that he believed the<br>young boy was rather stupid. However, Edison's mother knew better. She understood<br>that her son was very intelligent. She then took him away from school and began to<br>teach him herself.<br>As a young man, Thomas Edison became very interested in inventing new machines.<br>One of his first inventions was a small electrical machine that could be used for counting<br>votes. However, the government was not interested in his invention. But Edison was not<br>discouraged. He continued inventing, and his next invention was an electrical machine<br>that could be used for recording the prices of stocks. This invention was very popular<br>and successful.<br>Probably the most famous invention of Edison's is the electric light bulb. Before Edison,<br>there had been some electric lights, but these were very expensive. In 1879, Edison<br>invented a new kind of light bulb that could shine for a long time. Within a few years,<br>Edison's electric lights were used on the streets of cities in many countries. Soon after,<br>people began using electric lights in their homes.<br>Another invention of Edison's is no longer used today. That invention was called the<br>phonograph. It was a machine that could be used to record sounds, such as music and<br>conversation. When Edison invented this machine, in 1877, it was the first time that<br>anyone had been able to preserve sounds. Today, people do not use the phonograph any<br>more. Instead, they use compact discs (or CDs) to record music and other sounds.<br>Edison also helped to improve some inventions that already existed. For example, he<br>made improvements to the telephone and to the cameras that are used in making movies.<br>However, Edison is most famous for his inventions, such as the light bulb and the<br>phonograph.<br>Edison lived to an old age, and he died in 1931. Although Edison was an extremely<br>creative man, he believed that his success was due to many hours of hard work. He once<br>said that @x@Genius is one per cent inspiration, and ninety-nine percent perspiration.@x@ In<br>other words, a successful person should have good ideas, but the most important thing<br>is to work very hard.<br>",

        Title: "Capital Punishment, or The Death Penalty",
        Content:
          "In some countries, there has been much debate surrounding the issue of capital punishment.<br>“Capital punishment” is another term for the death penalty-the idea that some crimes should be<br>punished with death for the criminal who commits them.Capital punishment has existed at some time within virtually all countries.  In English-speaking countries, the use of capital punishment is much more limited nowadays than it was in the past.<br>For example, in 18th century  England, there were over 200 “capital crimes,” including petty theft and forgery!  Few criminals were actually put to death for these minor offences, but the laws were changed so that only very serious crimes, such as murder or treason, would be punished by death.<br>During the 19th and 20th centuries, many people began to believe that capital punishment was always wrong.  They argued that the death penalty was a cruel form of punishment, and that no state had the right to take the life of an individual.  Many countries began to abolish the death penalty, and today most countries no longer use capital punishment.<br>Several countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia, continue to use capital punishment.<br>Among English-speaking countries, the United States is the most prominent example of a country that still has the death penalty. However, some of the states within the USA have eliminated capital punishment.<br>There has been much debate within the United States (and other countries) about capital punishment.<br>Some people are in favor of the death penalty, for several reasons.   Some argue that a person who commits an evil crime such as murder deserves capital punishment.  Others argue that the death penalty may deter criminals from committing crimes.  Others argue that capital punishment is the only way to be certain that a criminal will not commit crimes again.<br>Many other people are against the death penalty, for several reasons.  Some argue that it is simply cruel and immoral to kill another person, even as punishment for committing terrible crimes.  They argue that the death  penalty does not really deter crime, and that the death penalty is usually applied to people who are poor or who belong to minority groups.  They also point out that innocent people are sometimes mistakenly convicted and executed, and that the death penalty does not allow those mistakes to be corrected.<br>The issue of the death penalty will probably continue to attract debate for many years to come.<br>But it seems that capital punishment is gradually being eliminated throughout the world.<br>",

        Title: "Continental Drift",
        Content:
          "Did you know that Europe and North America are slowly moving away from each other,<br>at the rate of about four centimetres per year?  This movement seems far too slow to be of<br>any importance, but over a period of millions of years, continents can move great distances<br>across the surface of the Earth.<br>Until the early 20th century, scientists assumed that the locations of the continents were fixed.<br>But a young German scientist named Alfred Wegener began to question that assumption.<br>He noticed several facts that suggested the possibility that continents could move.<br>First, Wegener noticed that the coastlines of some continents seemed that they could fit together.<br>A good example of this is the west coast of Africa and the east coast of South America.<br>This suggested that these continents had long ago @x@broken apart@x@ from each other.<br>Also, Wegener knew that some similar species of animals lived on continents that were very far apart.  This made him wonder if those species had once been a single species that lived in one homeland.  Those species would then have diverged when the continents divided.<br>In addition, Wegener found that some of the landforms on distant continents were quite similar.<br>For example, the rocks that make up the mountains of Scotland are similar to the rocks that make up the mountains of the eastern United States.<br>At first, Wegener's idea was ridiculed by many scientists.  They thought that his theory of continental drift was absurd.  Part of the reason for this was that Wegener did not know how this movement of continents could happen. Unfortunately, Wegener died in 1930, at the age of 50, when he was on a scientific expedition to Greenland.<br>During the 1960s, scientists realized that Wegener had been right.  New discoveries showed that<br>the continents rested on top of giant @x@plates,@x@ that could slide around the Earth, above a layer of molten rock.<br>Today, the idea of continental drift has been shown to be basically correct.<br>The movement of continents accounts for the creation of many mountain ranges, which rise when continents slowly collide.  It also accounts for the creation of many valleys, which sink when continents slowly break apart. Continental drift also explains why the fossils of tropical plants and animals are sometimes found on islands in very cold places: those islands had once been located in warmer parts of the earth!<br>Wegener's theory of continental drift was a revolutionary and radical idea. Eventually, however, this theory turned out to be correct. It is too bad that Wegener did not live to see the<br>acceptance of this theory.<br>",

        Title: "Come to the Fair",
        Content:
          "Fall fairs have been a feature of North American life since early in the nineteenth century.<br>At the end of the harvest, people from rural areas have come together to celebrate.<br>Usually, these fairs take the form of a competition regarding the best of all farm products<br>of that year. Depending on the part of the country, and its most important crop, fall fairs<br>can begin as early as August or as late as November. They usually last several days.<br>When the United States and Canada were organized, they were divided into small units<br>called counties. Larger units were called states or provinces. Many of the best-known<br>fairs are county fairs or state fairs. There are also smaller local fairs, and larger ones too,<br>like the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Ontario.<br>Since these fairs are usually annual events, many have developed permanent buildings<br>over the years. Most of these are large barn-like structures. These buildings are used to<br>display new products for farm life, such as tractors, home furnishings and water systems.<br>Several barns are usually necessary to house all the horses, cows, pigs, goats, sheep,<br>chickens and other animals in competition. There must also be room to display all the<br>vegetables, berries and fruits in competition. Finally, there is space for handicrafts,<br>artwork, baked goods, and jams and jellies.<br>Usually, there is a grandstand, which is a stage with wooden seats around it. Here<br>entertainers perform for an audience during the fair. Country and western singers are<br>usually popular at fairs, but so are comedians, clowns, dancers and musicians. There<br>may also be other contests such as a beauty competition for queen of the fair, tests of<br>strength for the men or pie-eating events. Most fairs also have a racetrack, which is used<br>for horse racing, or, in some cases, auto-racing.<br>Fairs have helped to improve animal breeds, and races encourage the breeding of fast<br>horses. Ploughing contests test the strength and steadiness of horses, and so do pulling<br>contests. This spirit of competition has led to improvements in all areas of farming. Every<br>kind of grain, fruit, vegetable, berry and animal is tested, and only the best win a ribbon.<br>This encourages fairness to improve their products.<br>Farm women compete to produce the best homemade food and crafts. Many kinds of<br>fruit and vegetables are stored in glass jars for the winter. The best of these also receive<br>prizes. Most fairs have a dining area where this good food is served to the public.<br>The goal of improving farming is sponsored by the governments of Canada and the<br>U.S.A. Four-H Clubs are youth organizations that encourage farm children to take an<br>interest in farming. Four-H Clubs aim at improving the heads, hearts, hands and health of<br>their members. There are also women's organizations, such as the Women's Institutes in<br>Canada, which work to make the life of farm families better. Fall fairs have taken over the<br>idea of the midway from the circus. The midway has rides like Ferris wheels, merry-go-<br>rounds, and roller coasters. It also has games of chance and skill, such as trying to<br>throw a small hoop over a large bottle. One nice thing about fall fairs is that they are fun<br>for the whole family. Children enjoy the midway and the farm animals. Women like the<br>crafts, food and household exhibits. Men like the machinery, the horse races and the crop<br>exhibits. Everyone likes the grandstand shows. Nowadays, not so many people live on<br>farms. But people from towns and cities still enjoy going to fall fairs. They are part of our<br>North American heritage.<br>",

They learn<br>about what happened at 8:15 am on August 6, 1945. People were eating breakfast;<br>children were going to school and adults going to work. There was a blinding flash of<br>light, a scorching heat, and a mushroom cloud rose up. People close to the explosion<br>were instantly vaporized. Many of those further away would die from burns and radiation.<br>Sixty thousand houses were destroyed immediately. One concrete structure remained<br>standing, although it was damaged. The local government left the Atomic Dome standing<br>as a memorial to the explosion.<br>Even those who were not seriously injured in the explosion later became very ill. They<br>became very sick from radiation poisoning. Many developed leukemia. Sadako Sasaki<br>was two years old when the bomb exploded. She was apparently uninjured and grew up<br>normally until she was twelve. Then she developed leukemia, a disease of the blood and<br>bone marrow. Sadako began to fold paper cranes to protect her from the illness. However,<br>she died in 1955 before she reached 1,000 paper cranes. Her example inspired the<br>Children's Monument at Hiroshima.<br>There is a Peace Museum in Hiroshima which has objects left by the explosion. These<br>include bottles, metal, stones and tiles twisted into strange shapes by the heat. There are<br>objects on which people were vaporized, so that their shape appears like a shadow on<br>the material. There are bits of burnt clothing and many photographs.<br>Why was the bomb dropped? World War II was a long and bitter war. The rules of war,<br>which said not to kill civilians, were forgotten. Hitler bombed London, hoping to break<br>the spirit of the English. Then England bombed Germany to destroy the factories and kill<br>the people who worked in them. Americans wanted revenge for the Japanese attack on<br>Pearl Harbor. The U.S. government had spent six billion dollars developing the A-bomb<br>and wanted to use it. Some say that they also wanted to warn the Russians not to cause<br>trouble for America.<br>When American forces advanced on Japan in 1945, they had to decide what to do. Would<br>Japan surrender, or would they fight to the last soldier? American leaders feared that<br>they might lose many men by an invasion. Dropping the atomic bomb would end the war<br>very quickly. President Truman made the decision to use it.<br>Since then, most people have felt that this decision was wrong. It was such a terrible<br>thing to do to people - children, old people, women, men and babies. Hiroshima inspired<br>many people to try to @x@ban the bomb.@x@ They wanted to ensure that atomic bombs would<br>not be used again. Even some of the scientists and aircrews involved in making and<br>dropping the bomb at Hiroshima wanted it banned. Perhaps if we can all remember what<br>happened that day, there will be no more Hiroshima's.<br>",

Summers at the Falls are especially busy, with traffic jams<br>and parking problems. However, the Falls are beautiful in winter too.<br>Many have asked why people travel so far to see water falling over a cliff. The size and<br>beauty of Niagara Falls help to make it special. While many falls are higher than Niagara,<br>very few are as wide or have such a volume of water. It also helps that Niagara is<br>relatively easy to travel to.<br>When the first Europeans came to Niagara, the Falls were surrounded by forest. The<br>noise of the Falls could be heard miles away, before they were actually seen. The first<br>visitors were filled with horror at the sight.<br>Later, fear ceased to be the main emotion inspired by the Falls. Later, visitors were<br>impressed by the beauty and grandeur of the Falls, which overwhelmed them with<br>wonder.<br>By the 1830s, people were able to come to the Falls by railway. As more and more people<br>came, the tourist industry developed. Early tourism was not well regulated, and there<br>were many complaints about cheats and swindles. Today, there are similar complaints<br>about tourist junk and high prices.<br>The majority of tourists stay on the Canadian side. There are two falls, separated by an<br>island. Since the Niagara River forms the boundary here between Canada and the United<br>States, each country has one of the falls. The Canadian Horseshoe Falls is wider and<br>more impressive than the American Rainbow Falls. About nine times more water goes<br>over the Canadian Falls. Nonetheless, there is much to be seen on the American side.<br>The island in the middle, Goat Island, is one of the best places to view the falls and<br>rapids. It is on the American side.<br>Newly married couples began coming to Niagara Falls when it was still a secluded,<br>peaceful and romantic spot. It is still popular with newly-weds as a relatively inexpensive<br>and convenient place to spend their honeymoon.<br>Besides being beautiful, Niagara Falls is also very useful. Their falling water is the power<br>behind several of the largest hydroelectric stations in the world. Much of the electric<br>power used in this part of North America comes from Niagara Falls. In order to harness<br>this power, half of the flow of water is channeled away from the falls during the night, and<br>during the non-tourist season. Probably most visitors don't notice the difference.<br>Niagara has attracted many kinds of people over the years. Businessmen have come to<br>profit from the tourists. Daredevils have come to make a name for themselves. Some<br>have gone over the falls in a barrel, while others have walked above the falls on a<br>tightrope. Poets and artists have visited here to capture its beauty. Lovers have come to<br>gaze on its romantic scenery. All of these, and many others, have helped to make Niagara<br>Falls world famous.<br>",

        Content:
          "The Golden Age of the American cowboy was short lived. It began in the 1860s with the<br>great cattle drives from Texas north to Kansas. By 1890, when railroads had reached<br>remote areas, there was no more need for large-scale cattle drives.<br>Of course, cowboys have a history before 1860. In fact, there were Mexican cowboys<br>long before that. The Spanish conqueror of Mexico, Hernan Cortes, brought cattle with<br>him 1521. Cortes also branded his cattle with a three cross design. The Spanish sharp-<br>horned cattle roamed the deserts and prairies freely. Eventually, they found their way to<br>Texas. American settlers in Texas interbred their animals with the Spanish breed - the<br>Texas longhorn cow was the result! It was famous for its bad temper and aggressiveness.<br>The Longhorn was a dangerous animal, with each of its horns measuring up to three and<br>one-half feet long.<br>After the American Civil War ended in 1865, disbanded soldiers, who were former black<br>slaves, and young men seeking adventure headed west. At that time, there were about<br>five million cattle in Texas. Back in the East, there was a big demand for beef. By this<br>time, railways from the east extended as far west as Kansas. It was still more than 600<br>miles from South Texas to the railway. Between the two places there were rivers to cross,<br>Indian tribes, badlands and other problems. A fur trader named Jesse Chisholm had<br>driven his wagon north in 1865. Cowboys and cattle followed the Chisholm Trail north to<br>Abilene, Kansas. This cattle trail became the most famous route for driving cattle, until it<br>was barred with barbed wire in 1884.<br>In 1867, cattle dealer Joseph G. McCoy built pens for 3,000 cattle in the little town of<br>Abilene. Soon Abilene was the most dangerous town in America. After the long cattle<br>drive, cowboys who had just been paid went wild. Sheriff @x@Wild Bill@x@ Hickok tamed<br>Abilene in 1871 by forcing cowboys to turn over their guns when they arrived in town.<br>Other towns replaced Abilene as the wildest town in the West - Newton, Wichita,<br>Ellsworth and Dodge City.<br>In Kansas a herd of 3,000 Texas longhorns might sell for $100,000 making the rancher<br>rich. The cowboys might get $200 in wages, which often disappeared on drink, women<br>and gambling.<br>Getting cattle to Kansas was far from easy. One of the biggest difficulties was getting the<br>herd across rivers, especially when the river was high. There were no bridges. In 1871,<br>350 cowboys driving 60,000 cattle waited two weeks for the water level in the Red River<br>to go down.<br>Food for men and animals was also difficult to find at times. An early cattleman<br>developed the chuck wagon, which were both a supply wagon and a portable kitchen.<br>In the 1870s, there were probably 40,000 cowboys in the West. After the prairies were<br>fenced in, there was less work. Large ranches still employ cowboys to round up the<br>cattle for branding or for sale. Even today, about 20,000 cowboys still work in North<br>America.<br>",

Bush. He had also been Governor of Texas since 1994. However, aside from<br>this, he was not very well known outside of Texas. Why then did so many people want<br>him to run for president in 2000?<br>Many republicans thought that the democrats could be defeated in 2000. But they<br>themselves lacked a candidate with strong appeal. As the election approached, leading<br>publicans worried about whom to support. Some of the most powerful republicans were<br>state governors. They began to look around at each other for a possible candidate. Most<br>eyes turned to George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas. In November 1998, Bush was re-<br>elected as Governor by an impressive margin. By now, Bush was the leading republican<br>candidate in the polls.<br>Of course, one advantage that Governor Bush had was a familiar name. In fact, when he<br>did well in some early polls, it is likely that some people really voted for his father. They<br>thought that George H. W. Bush was running again. The Bush family was able to swing a<br>lot of support to George W. It also helped that his brother, Jeb, was now Governor of<br>Florida.<br>Parents George and Barbara were both born in eastern United States. But in 1948,<br>George moved to Texas where he made a fortune in the oil business. He went into<br>politics in the 1960s and 70s and served in a number of important positions. He was<br>Ronald Reagan's Vice President from 1981-1989, and President from 1989-1993.<br>George W. was born in 1946, the oldest of the Bush children. Three more brothers and<br>two sisters were also born. The youngest sister died of leukemia as a child.<br>George W. attended the same prestigious eastern colleges as his father. Then he came<br>back to Texas and was a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National Guard. During the early<br>'70s he wandered from place to place, trying different jobs.

        Title: "Handel's @x@Messiah@x@",
        Content:
          "George Frederick Handel was a native of Germany and spoke with a German accent all<br>his life. Most of that life, however, was spent in London, England. As a young musician,<br>Handel's sponsor was the Elector of Hanover. Later on, when the Elector became King<br>George I of England, he continued to sponsor Handel.<br>The young Handel went to Italy to study opera. Opera had become a very fashionable<br>entertainment for the upper classes. Handel traveled to England in 1711 and made an<br>immediate success with his operas. Queen Anne granted him a royal pension for life in<br>1713. Because of this initial success, Handel tried to start a permanent opera company in<br>London. But this failed and Handel lost money.<br>Since operas used full stage settings with costumes, scenery and props, they were<br>expensive to produce. Handel decided to produce oratorios in which the parts were<br>simply sung without actions.<br>On August 22, 1741, Handel began to work on his oratorio @x@The Messiah.@x@ The text was<br>made up of passages from the Bible relating to the birth, life and death of Jesus. Handel<br>worked on it feverishly, missing meals and going without sleep. He finished it twenty-four<br>days later. When he was asked how he felt on completing it, Handel said, @x@I thought I saw<br>all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself.@x@<br>In the fall of 1741, Handel received an invitation from the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to<br>present operas and concerts there. Handel traveled from London to Dublin with his entire<br>luggage and many of his singers. However, in order to rehearse on the way, he had to<br>hire local people to fill in. Once, the composer soundly criticized one local singer who<br>failed to meet his standards.<br>Handel was warmly received in Dublin, where his concerts were sold out. Even his<br>rehearsals were considered newsworthy by the local papers. @x@The Messiah@x@ was first<br>publicly performed on April 13, 1742. Seven hundred people squeezed into a 600-seat<br>theatre to hear it. A notice had requested that ladies attend in hoopless skirts, and that<br>gentlemen come without their swords. A Dublin paper reported, @x@Words are wanting to<br>express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring crowded audience.@x@ All proceeds<br>were donated to charity, as the church choirs had refused to participate except on those<br>conditions.<br>Handel returned to London in August 1742 and prepared the oratorio for the London<br>stage. @x@The Messiah@x@ made its London debut on March 23, 1743, with King George II in<br>the audience. It was during the Hallelujah Chorus that the King jumped to his feet and so<br>initiated a tradition that has lasted ever since.<br>With such oratories, Handel was able to re-establish his popularity and restore his<br>finances in London. @x@The Messiah@x@ continued to be performed. After conducting it on<br>April 6, 1759, the old composer collapsed and had to be carried home. He died eight days<br>later.<br>@x@The Messiah@x@ remains Handel's most popular work, combining wonderful music with<br>inspiring religious sentiments. The Biblical text speaks of hope and salvation, and the<br>music allows the text to soar into angelic songs.<br>",

          "Ireland is an island in the Atlantic Ocean just west of Britain. For much of its history, it<br>has been an advantage to Ireland to be far from the mainland. The Romans or the other<br>early Empires never conquered Ireland. It was the remoteness of Ireland that helped<br>preserve much of Christian and classical culture. After the fall of the Roman Empire,<br>wandering tribes destroyed much of what remained on the continent.<br>Finally, it was Ireland's turn to be invaded. First, the Norsemen or Vikings attacked during<br>the 800s and 900s. Then in the 1100s, the English invaded Ireland. Since that time, there<br>has always been an English presence in Ireland. The conflict between the English and<br>the Irish grew worse in the 1500s. Then the English became Protestant, and the Irish<br>remained Catholic. In the 1600s, Oliver Cromwell tried to make Ireland Protestant by<br>driving out the Catholics and bringing in Protestant settlers. In the centuries following,<br>Irish Catholics had very few rights in their own country. The Catholic Irish were not<br>allowed to vote until 1829.<br>Since Irish Catholics were not allowed to own land, they were poor tenant farmers. They<br>paid rent to the English landlords. The main food crop in the 1840s was potatoes. When<br>these became infected by blight, thousands of Irishmen starved. Many others were<br>evicted from their dwellings because they couldn't pay the rent. Hundreds of thousands<br>of Irish took ship for North America. The Catholic Irish preferred to go to the United<br>States because Canada was under British influence. However, many Protestant Irish went<br>to Canada.<br>The influence of the Irish on North American culture has been very great in many areas.<br>Prominent Irish-Americans include Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.<br>Meanwhile, in Ireland itself, a strong independence movement developed. A rebellion<br>against England in 1916 began a struggle that resulted in independence for most of<br>Ireland. Some Protestant areas in Northern Ireland preferred to stay with England.<br>Republican groups such as the Irish Republican Army wanted to @x@liberate@x@ the north from<br>British rule. Nowadays, conflict between Protestants and Catholics is limited to these<br>northern counties. Constant attempts are being made to bring the conflict there to an end.<br>Meanwhile, the Irish Republic, or Eire, has become prosperous again. It can sell its<br>agricultural products to the European Common Market. Irish beer and whisky are sold all<br>over the world. Ireland is also becoming known for its high-tech industries. Because of<br>this relative prosperity, the population is increasing again, after a century and a half of<br>decline.<br>The Irish differ from other people because the vast majority of Irishmen live away from<br>their homeland. However, this exodus from Ireland has helped to spread Irish music,<br>culture and products around the world. On St. Patrick's Day (March 17th), nearly<br>everyone becomes Irish for the day. Then there is a great party with Celtic music, Irish<br>dancing, green beer and the wearing of the green.<br>",

          "New England in the early and middle years of the nineteenth century had a flourishing<br>culture. People were passionately interested in ideas and education. Most New<br>Englanders were strongly opposed to slavery. They were also concerned about other<br>social issues.<br>New ideas resulted in new kinds of writing. These ideas included the importance of doing<br>what seemed right for them, no matter how different it was from what other people<br>thought. People also believed that nature gave them guidance in our lives and that it was<br>important to live close to nature. These and other ideas were expressed through teaching<br>and writing.<br>Bronson Alcott was one of those who looked at the world in a new way. He looked for<br>work as a teacher so that he could pass on his ideas to others. However, very few<br>parents wanted Mr. Alcott to teach their children. And very few people were interested in<br>hearing his speeches or reading his books. As a result, the Alcott family was very poor<br>Fortunately for Bronson, he married a very capable and energetic woman. Mrs. Abigail<br>Alcott helped to earn money to support the family and did most of the work involved in<br>looking after the four Alcott girls. The oldest daughter, Anna, was quiet and serious. She<br>rarely got into trouble and was a good helper at home. The second daughter was Louisa<br>May Alcott, who became a writer. She was adventurous and cared very little for rules.<br>She was always saying and doing things that got her into trouble. The third daughter,<br>Elizabeth, was very kind and good-natured. All the others loved her. As a young woman,<br>Elizabeth had a severe case of scarlet fever and never fully recovered. She died at age 23.<br>The youngest sister, May, was talented, but she was rather spoiled.<br>Because there was never enough money, the Alcott girls felt pressure to work at an early<br>age. But this did not stop them from having fun. Louisa wrote little plays that she and her<br>sisters performed at home. They all enjoyed the woods and ponds around Concord,<br>Massachusetts, where they live most of these years. When they moved back to Boston in<br>1848, Anna took a job looking after other people's children, and Louisa looked after the<br>house. Meanwhile, their mother worked outside the home.<br>While working on laundry or sewing, Louisa was thinking up stories. At night she would<br>write them down. When she was eighteen, she began selling poems and stories to<br>magazines. Within ten years, Louisa was earning a substantial income from writing. One<br>day her publisher suggested that she write a story for girls. At first Louisa didn't like the<br>suggestion. But when she started to write, the ideas came rapidly. Her book was based<br>on her own family and her own childhood.<br>@x@Little Women@x@ was published in 1868 and was an immediate success. The March family<br>was very much like the Alcotts. Mrs. Alcott resembles @x@Marmee.@x@ @x@Meg@x@ is like Anna, and<br>@x@Jo@x@ is like Louisa herself. @x@Beth@x@ is based on Elizabeth and @x@Amy@x@ on May Alcott. Many<br>of the situations in the book happened to the Alcott family.

It used to be true that very few tourists would bother to<br>travel from the Falls down to Niagara-on-the-Lake. Nowadays, however, the little town<br>itself is a major tourist attraction.<br>The town has a remarkable history. The area played an important role in both the<br>American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. As a result, the little town has two forts,<br>Fort George and Fort Mississauga.

On a summer's day, visitors can watch the sailboats going out the<br>river to the lake. On the landside, Niagara is part of the fruit belt of Ontario. Peaches,<br>pears, apples, cherries and strawberries grow here in abundance. There are also long<br>rows of vines, and winemaking has recently become a major industry.<br>The mild humid climate allows plants to flourish. The trees, especially the oaks, grow to<br>remarkable heights. Flowering trees and shrubs perfume the air in the spring. Gardens<br>are often spectacular for much of the year. Because of this, Niagara-on-the-Lake attracts<br>many painters and photographers. Many of the private homes also have a long history,<br>and great care is taken to keep them looking their best.<br>The biggest single attraction is the Shaw Festival Theatre. The Festival was founded in<br>1962 by a group of Shaw enthusiasts. Early productions were often held in the historic<br>Court House on the main street, and plays still take place there. In 1973, however, a new<br>861 seat Shaw Theatre was built at the south end of town. Since then, traffic to Niagara-<br>on-the-Lake has been steady all through the long summer season.<br>In 1996, Niagara-on-the-Lake was voted @x@the prettiest town in Canada.@x@ Partly, it is the<br>scale of things that makes the old town so attractive.

There are many interesting shops,<br>old hotels, bookstores, art galleries, museums, a golf course, a marina, historic churches<br>and cemeteries, several parks, three theatres and lots of restaurants.<br>Because it is small, Niagara-on-the-Lake is a good place to walk around or bicycle<br>around. There are also horse and wagon rides. Although the main street can be hectic in<br>tourist season, one doesn't have to go far off the main street to get in touch with an older<br>slower time. Most of the downtown buildings haven't changed much since the days of<br>Queen Victoria, and tourists can still imagine that they are back in the days before<br>computers and television<br>",

        Title: "Newspapers",
        Content:
          "All the great cities in the world now have newspapers. But newspapers, as we know them<br>today, are not that old. The very first newspapers began long after the invention of<br>printing. They started in Europe in the 1600s, and were usually only a couple of pages<br>long. For a long time, newspapers were not very common. Governments didn't want<br>public discussion of their policies and decisions. Often they closed down papers, or<br>taxed them heavily. The @x@Stamp Tax@x@ on newspapers and pamphlets was one of the<br>causes of the American Revolution.<br>Newspapers began to grow in size when they discovered advertising as a source of<br>income. Nowadays, advertising is the main revenue source for most newspapers. As<br>newspapers became more widely circulated, they could ask for more money for their<br>advertisements. By the late eighteenth century, newspapers were in common use in<br>Europe.<br>The 1800s and early 1900s was the golden age of newspapers. Improvements in<br>transportation, communication and printing processes made it easier to collect news<br>from near and far and to publish papers more quickly and more cheaply. The Weekly<br>Dispatch and the Times, both of London, England, were leading newspapers through<br>much of the 1800s. The Times was one of the first papers to include illustrations. It was<br>the first newspaper to use a steam engine to turn the presses. When the tax on<br>newspapers was reduced in 1836, the Times was able to increase its size considerably. In<br>1840, it began to use the telegraph to collect news stories. In 1855 the tax on newspapers<br>was finally lifted.<br>The Times made its greatest reputation during the Crimean War between Britain and<br>Russia. British armies, fighting in Russia's Crimean Peninsula, were not only<br>unsuccessful in the war, but were suffering severely from illnesses. The Times sent out<br>the world's first war correspondent, William Howard Russell, in 1854. His reports from<br>the battle lines had a powerful effect on the British public. A War Fund was organized to<br>help the soldiers. Russell forced the government to accept the offer of Florence<br>Nightingale to organize nurses to travel to Crimea. A photographer, Roger Fenton, sent<br>back photos from the war, which were published in the Times.<br>Meanwhile in America, a more popular approach to newspapers had developed. The<br>newspaper had spread west with the pioneers, and nearly every little settlement had its<br>own paper. American newspapers were cheaper and livelier than British ones. They were<br>aimed at the average person, rather than the governing class. Examples of the new style<br>of editing and publishing were Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst. Hearst,<br>especially, employed sensational and emotional writing, which aimed at stirring up the<br>public to action. Hearst is sometimes accused of starting the Spanish-American War of<br>1898 with his over-heated editorials. Nonetheless, his methods were successful in<br>raising circulation and were widely imitated.<br>The modern newspaper contains more than hard news. In fact, news may be a fairly small<br>part of it. Advertisements, gossip, show business, photos of celebrities, sports, stock<br>market prices, horoscopes, comic strips, weather reports and much more are found in its<br>pages. The modern newspaper is a total entertainment package. A question for the future<br>is whether electronic newspapers will replace paper newspapers.<br>",

        Content:
          "Since Christopher Columbus first met American Indians in 1492, many Europeans had<br>been fascinated by Indian life and culture. As a result, there was a demand in Europe for<br>drawings and paintings of Native Americans. European artists who had never seen an<br>Indian supplied most of this demand. But in the nineteenth century, several painters<br>traveled into Indian Territory to make an authentic record of native life. One of the first<br>artists to do this was the American painter George Catlin. In 1841, Catlin published a<br>book of his work. Catlin's work helped inspire another important frontier artist, the<br>Canadian Paul Kane.<br>Paul Kane was born in Ireland in 1810. His family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada,<br>when Paul was nine years old. The young boy was not very interested in school. At that<br>time, there were still Indians living in wigwams in the Toronto area. Young Paul liked<br>visiting the Indian village instead of going to school.<br>Since Paul spent little time in school, he was largely a self-taught artist. He also became<br>a surprisingly good writer, considering that he had not spent much time studying<br>spelling or grammar. After working some years making and decorating furniture, Kane<br>was ready to travel. He spent the years from 1836 to 1841 living and traveling in the<br>United States. Then he traveled in Europe from 1841 to 1843, studying the great painters<br>of the past. He was back in the U.S.A. until 1845, and then he returned to Toronto.<br>Immediately upon his return, Kane headed into the wilderness areas around Georgian<br>Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, and Lake Michigan. His plan was to sketch Indian life before it<br>disappeared forever. American Indians were dying so rapidly from European diseases,<br>such as measles and smallpox, that many people believed that they would soon vanish<br>as a race. Their culture was threatened too. As white settlers demanded more land,<br>Indians were being herded into small pieces of land called @x@reservations.@x@ Here they<br>could no longer practice their traditional way of life. Kane wanted to capture Native<br>American life while it still existed.<br>Kane returned to Toronto at the end of 1845. He had received one good piece of advice<br>and that was if he wanted to travel into the wilderness, he would have to go with<br>experienced people. He was able to get the support of the Governor of the Hudson's Bay<br>Company, Sir George Simpson. In May 1846, Kane joined the annual canoe fleet of fur<br>traders going west. Kane would travel all through the wilderness areas of western<br>Canada and northwestern U.S.A. During this time, he made hundreds of sketches of<br>Indian life.<br>Although Kane faced incredible hardships during his travels, he was able to see what he<br>wanted to see. He was able to take part in one of the last great Buffalo hunts and killed<br>two large bison himself. Traveling west with the fur traders he visited many forts and<br>trading posts. He saw and painted a prairie fire. He shot a grizzly bear at close range and<br>killed several wolves that attacked his horses. He learned to travel long distances on<br>snowshoes in winter. Finally, he arrived at the Pacific coast, where he made some fine<br>drawings of the west coast Indians. European diseases had reached there just before<br>Kane. Fifteen hundred Indians had died near Fort Vancouver in the summer of 1848. One<br>wealthy chief had ruled 1,000 warriors and had ten wives, four children and eighteen<br>slaves. Now he had only one wife, one child and two slaves. Kane had not come too soon.<br>However, there were tribes still unaffected by western culture and western diseases.<br>Kane also traveled widely around the Columbia River in northwestern U.S.A. Everywhere<br>he went, he sketched Indian chiefs and scenes of native life. On his return trip, he<br>encountered a large war party of 1,500 braves on the warpath against their traditional<br>enemies. He was able to sketch the leading chief, Big Snake, who was later killed in<br>single combat during the battle.<br>When he arrived back in Toronto, Kane gave an exhibit of his sketches and watercolors.<br>Most of the rest of his life was spent turning these drawings into finished paintings.<br>",

          "The best known picture of an American Indian is a warrior in buckskin, riding a horse,<br>wearing a headdress of eagle feathers and carrying a spear, or bow and arrow. This is a<br>picture of a Plains Indian, and it appears in many Hollywood westerns and on the<br>American five-cent piece. There were many tribes of Plains Indians; for the Northern<br>American prairies or plains stretch from the northern forest of western Canada down to<br>the States of Oklahoma and Texas in southern U.S.A.<br>It is interesting that our image of the Plains Indian is only true for the last couple hundred<br>years. It was not until the 1600s that Plains Indians began to ride horses. There were no<br>horses in America until Spanish soldiers brought them in the 1500s and 1600s. Some of<br>these horses escaped and ran wild on the prairies of America. It was these wild horses<br>that the Plains Indians learned to tame.<br>Before they had horses, the Indians hunted buffalo on foot. Buffalo were huge bison, or<br>wild cattle, which traveled in very large herds. A big herd might have millions of buffalo.<br>It was difficult to cross the prairie because these animals blocked your way.<br>The Plains Indians had various ways of killing buffalo. Before they had horses, Indian<br>hunters would quietly creep up close to the herd; then they would fire their arrows<br>together. There was always the danger that the herd would stampede and trample the<br>hunters. Another method was to drive the buffalo over a steep cliff. There are a number<br>of places on the plains where this was done.<br>Once the Plains Indians had horses, they preferred to hunt buffalo on horseback. When<br>the tribes started to use guns, they could kill many buffalo. Artist Paul Kane describes a<br>buffalo hunt in the Red River Valley in 1846. The hunters carried their bullets in their<br>mouths so that they could shoot faster. They would ride right into the herd, shooting at<br>close quarters. They would drop an article of clothes on the slain buffalo to mark it for<br>themselves. Then they would continue the hunt. After the hunt, the Indians would skin<br>the animals, and the women would dry the meat and store it in fat. A single hunt might<br>kill more than 30,000 buffalo.<br>The Plains Indians received nearly everything they needed from the buffalo. Of course,<br>they used buffalo meat for food. They also used the buffalo skins for clothing, blankets,<br>and the covering of their teepees. These teepees were cone-shaped tents, which were<br>easy to put up and take down. Plains Indians were nomadic, and followed the animals<br>they hunted. Since these animals were plentiful, Plains Indians usually led a comfortable<br>life. They developed complex religions and social rituals, as well as specialized societies<br>or clubs. There were also rituals and customs for hunting and warfare.<br>Many Plains Indians fought hard against the settlement of the Great Plains. The American<br>government discouraged the hunting of buffalo, because without the buffalo the Plains<br>Indians would not be able to fight. With the buffalo disappearing, the Plains Indians had<br>to give up fighting and move into government-sponsored reservations.<br>",

          "In 1606, King James of England approved the establishment of two colonies along the<br>eastern coast of America. The northern colony in Maine lasted only a year. The southern<br>one at Jamestown in Virginia became England's first permanent settlement in America.<br>In 1607, the Virginia Company sent 104 settlers to Virginia. The settlers lived in tents all<br>summer. By September, more than 60 were dead because they lacked good food or water.<br>The leaders of the colony were not energetic and did little to make the settlers find food.<br>One member of the company, Captain John Smith, was determined that the colony would<br>survive. Smith pressured the colonists to build huts, a storehouse, and a church. He<br>made daring trips to Indian villages, demanding that they give the settlers food in return<br>for beads and copper. He threatened settlers who were trying to leave the colony and go<br>back to England.<br>On one of his trips to the interior, Indians attacked John Smith. They killed his two<br>companions but captured him alive. He was taken first to the local chief. This chief was<br>impressed by Smith's compass and spared his life. His captors dragged Smith from<br>village to village. He finally arrived at the town belonging to Powhatan. Powhatan was the<br>great chief for all of the tribes in that region. Powhatan and his advisors talked about<br>what to do with Smith. Suddenly, Smith was dragged forward, and his head was pushed<br>against a stone. The warriors raised their clubs to kill Smith. Then Pocahontas, who was<br>Powhatan's twelve-year-old daughter, begged for his life. Her words had no effect, so<br>Pocahontas ran to Smith. She took his head in her arms and laid her own head against<br>his head. Smith was released and went back to Jamestown.<br>Soon after Smith returned, one hundred new settlers from England arrived. It was a very<br>cold winter, and in January, Jamestown was accidentally set on fire. The settlers suffered<br>from cold and hunger the rest of the winter. Every four or five days, Pocahontas and her<br>attendants came. They brought food for the hungry settlers. Even so, half of them died.<br>In the summer, John Smith explored that part of the coast of America. He made a map<br>that would be very valuable for future sailors and settlers.<br>On his return, Smith was elected leader of the colony at Jamestown. However, some<br>settlers did not like having to follow rules. Some encouraged the Indians to try to kill<br>Smith. Chief Powhatan agreed. He also refused to supply food to the colony, hoping to<br>starve them out. Pocahontas warned Smith about the plot against his life. Smith had to<br>fight off several attempts to kill him. Finally, the colony seemed to be growing, and the<br>Indians became peaceful. But in late 1609, Smith was injured in an explosion and<br>returned to England.<br>Pocahontas remained a friend to the colony. She married John Rolfe, one of the settlers.<br>In 1616, she traveled to England with her husband and son. There she saw John Smith<br>once again. She was so surprised to see him that she was unable to speak for several<br>days. Pocahontas had believed that Smith was dead. The following year she died and<br>was buried in England.<br>Pocahontas' love for Smith, and Smith's determination to fight for the colony, had saved<br>Jamestown and given the English their first colony in America.<br>",

        Title: "Remember The Alamo!",
        Content:
          "The first Europeans in the American Southwest were Spanish explorers and conquerors.<br>They were followed by religious orders that set up missions to Christianize the Indians.<br>One of these missions was San Antonio de Valero; it was founded in 1718 in what is now<br>San Antonio, Texas. Later, the mission structure became known as The Alamo.<br>In 1821, Moses Austin had persuaded the Spanish authorities to give him a charger to<br>settle 200,000 acres in Texas. The elder Austin died shortly after this. Five weeks later,<br>his son Stephen Austin traveled to San Antonio to have this charter confirmed by the<br>Spanish governor. In 1822, Austin led 150 settlers into Texas. When Austin learned<br>afterwards that Mexico was now independent of Spain, he journeyed to Mexico City to<br>have his charter reconfirmed. The Mexicans appointed Austin regional administrator for<br>his colony.<br>Texas grew rapidly. Cotton farming and cattle ranching were profitable and attracted<br>American settlers. By 1830, there were 16,000 Americans in Texas--four times the<br>Spanish-Mexican population.<br>Sam Houston had been a successful soldier and politician. He was a friend and<br>supporter of President Andrew Jackson. However, personal problems and political<br>difficulties led him to leave the U.S.A. for Texas.<br>Meanwhile, the struggle for control of Mexico had been won in 1833 by Santa Ana.<br>However, the independent thinking of the Texans infuriated Santa Ana. He had Stephen<br>Austin thrown in jail, and sent an army into Texas. Austin was released from jail in time to<br>organize the defense of Texas. The Mexican army was besieged inside the Alamo, and<br>after fierce fighting, surrendered. The Mexicans were allowed to go home.<br>Sam Houston was now elected the State's supreme commander. Not long after this,<br>Santa Ana approached Texas with an army of 6,000 men. Houston decided not to meet<br>Santa Ana in open battle but to wait for an advantage. He sent frontiersman Jim Bowie to<br>the Alamo. Bowie's orders were to leave San Antonio and destroy the Alamo.<br>When Bowie arrived, however, Texas volunteers were preparing the Alamo for a siege.<br>Bowie and his men pitched in to help. Other volunteers came. The fiery William Travis<br>arrived with 25 men. Then, the famous frontiersman, Davy Crockett, came with a dozen<br>Tennessee sharpshooters. When Santa Ana attacked, there were 183 Americans inside<br>the fort.<br>Santa Ana brought up cannon to bombard the Alamo. As the walls began to crumble,<br>4,000 Mexicans attacked from all four sides. The Mexicans overcame all resistance<br>because of their large numbers, but they suffered very heavy losses. All the American<br>defenders were killed.<br>While the battle was raging, the Texans back at the colony declared their independence<br>from Mexico.<br>Sam Houston now gathered men to fight the Mexican army. At first, he retreated while<br>waiting for a suitable opportunity. When Santa Ana's rapid advance left the bulk of the<br>Mexican army behind, Houston prepared to fight. Santa Ana's advance troops moved into<br>swampy land by the San Jacinto River. Houston's men attacked while the Mexicans were<br>having their midday siesta. Their battle cry was @x@Remember the Alamo!@x@ The battle was<br>soon over. Many Mexicans were killed, but only a couple of Texans were killed. Santa Ana<br>was a prisoner.<br>Santa Ana readily agreed now to recognize Texas as an independent republic. Ninety<br>years later, in 1845, Texas became the 28th State of the U.S.A.<br>",

        Content:
          "St. Francis of Assisi, who lived in Italy in the early thirteenth century, was known for his<br>love of animals. He was the first person who celebrated the birth of Jesus by gathering<br>live animals around a manger. He often talked to the birds as he traveled along.<br>Sometimes, the birds would fly down and sit on his head, shoulders, knees and arms.<br>But the best-known animal story concerns St. Francis and the Wolf of Gribbio. St. Francis<br>was known for his humility and his unwillingness to hurt anyone. Once, when one of his<br>followers spoke harshly to some bandits, St. Francis told the man to run after the bandits<br>and apologize. In the same way, St. Francis thought of animals as his brothers and<br>sisters. Once when he was warned about some dangerous wolves, he replied that he had<br>never harmed Brother Wolf, and didn't expect the wolf to harm him.<br>While St. Francis was staying the hill town of Gribbio, he heard about a large, fierce wolf.<br>The townspeople were terrified of this wolf that had eaten both domestic animals and<br>humans. St. Francis decided to help the people and went out to talk to the wolf. The<br>people watched in horror as the wolf came running to attack St. Francis. But the saint<br>made the sign of the cross. Then he said to the wolf that, in the name of Jesus, it should<br>stop hurting people. The wolf then lay down at St. Francis' feet.<br>St. Francis addressed a little sermon to the wolf. He recounted all the terrible things that<br>the wolf had done. But he added that he wanted to make peace between the wolf and the<br>townspeople. The wolf nodded its head in approval.<br>In return for the wolf's agreement to keep the peace, St. Francis promised him that he<br>would arrange for the townspeople to feed him. When he asked the wolf never again to<br>harm any person or animal, the wolf nodded again. Then the wolf put out its paw as a<br>sign that it would keep its promise.<br>The wolf walked beside St. Francis back into Gribbio. When a crowd assembled, the saint<br>preached to them about how God had allowed the wolf to terrify them because of their<br>sins. He told them to repent, and God would forgive them. Then he spoke of the promise<br>that the wolf had made and what he had promised the wolf in return. The people agreed<br>to feed the wolf regularly, and the wolf again indicated that it would not hurt anyone.<br>Again, it put its paw in St. Francis' hand.<br>The wolf and the people kept the agreement. Two years later the wolf died. The people<br>remembered how it no longer hurt anyone and that not a single dog ever barked at it. The<br>townspeople of Gribbio lamented its death. Whenever it went through town, it had<br>reminded them of the virtues and holiness of St. Francis.<br>",

        Content:
          "In North America, July and August are holiday months. Most schools and colleges are<br>not in session then. Families look for activities to keep the children amused. Although<br>not all workers get a full two months of holidays, most people take a holiday in the<br>summer.<br>The summer begins with a national holiday. In Canada, July 1st is Canada Day. In the<br>U.S.A., July 4th is Independence Day. A lot of families are soon on the road. Some travel<br>to cottages by the lake. Some go sightseeing or camping. In Canada, especially, the<br>summers are short. So people try to make the most of them.<br>In much of Canada, and parts of the northern U.S.A., are woodlands dotted with lakes.<br>These regions of rocks, rivers, pine trees and wild animals are not usually suitable for<br>farming. However, they are ideal places to spend a summer holiday. They are far from the<br>cities. The woods are quiet and peaceful. People fish, go boating or swimming, have<br>barbeques outside, or play outdoor sports. Some people spend their whole summer at<br>the cottage. Others go for a week or two.<br>City people who don't have a cottage like to go to parks and swimming pools in the city.<br>If they are near a lake or ocean, they may go there for the day. Many museums, libraries<br>and art galleries have programs for children in the summer.<br>Swimming is probably the favorite summer sport. It feels wonderful on a very hot day to<br>jump into the cool water. Swimming is also excellent exercise. Besides swimming,<br>baseball and football are also popular in the summer. Spending an afternoon or evening<br>at a baseball game is a favorite summer pastime.<br>Summer is also a favorite time to catch up on reading. Stories of adventures and love<br>novels are favorite light reading.<br>But summer is especially a time for traveling across the country. Some people have a<br>camper or trailer that they can live in. Some stay in campgrounds and sleep in tents.<br>Others stay at hotels or motels, while others rent cottages or cabins for a week or two.<br>Most trips are by car. Many people visit national parks and other wildlife areas. Of course,<br>trips along the ocean, and the lakes are favorites. Along the Atlantic Ocean, the coasts of<br>New England and Canada's Maritime Provinces are especially popular. On the Pacific<br>coast, tourists travel from California all the way up to Alaska. Boat cruises along the<br>shores of British Columbia and Alaska are especially popular.<br>Of course, some people find it most relaxing just to stay at home. Others cannot afford to<br>travel. If you have an air-conditioned house, with a television, video player, CD player and<br>computer, then it can be very pleasant to stay at home. A lot of new movies are released<br>at the theatres in the summer. Air-conditioned theatres with new movies and lots of pop<br>and popcorn are favorite summer places.<br>After two months of summer activities, most people are ready to go back to school and<br>work. But they usually have lots of happy memories to take back with them.<br>",

        Content:
          "When Alexander Graham Bell developed the telephone in the 1870s, it was fairly simple<br>to use. You talked into the mouthpiece and then held it to your ear to listen. For a century<br>of so, using the telephone meant either contacting the operator to dial a number, or<br>dialing yourself. After that, all you had to do was talk or listen.<br>Nowadays, the telephone has become a very complex instrument; it rivals the computer<br>as to the number of possible uses. Answering machines have been around for several<br>decades, but they are now being replaced by voicemail. Voicemail does away with the<br>need for an answering machine. Messages are stored on the system. That means that it<br>is possible to forward the message to someone else's phone, or transfer the call to a<br>more convenient phone of your own. You can also use @x@call pickup,@x@ so that anyone in<br>your group can answer another's phone.<br>Conference calls have become very common. This is when one person phones first one<br>person, then another, and keeps adding people to the telephone conversation. This can<br>regularly be done with up to six people. It is very useful for business discussions where<br>different people need to talk about the same thing. It also speeds up the process of<br>consensus, and allows everybody to be in on the decision or discussion.<br>The modern phone has many more features. If you don't want the caller to know what is<br>being said in your office, you can push the @x@mute@x@ button. If you want to hang up without<br>putting the receiver down, press @x@goodbye.@x@ If you don't want to receive calls, just<br>forward them all into your voicemail.<br>Newer phones will indicate when you have voicemail messages. If you have trouble with<br>these features, an automatic voice will tell you your options. This help-system is built<br>into the telephone. For example, the help-voice will tell you how to set up a distribution<br>list, so that you can send the same voice message to a number of people. It will also tell<br>you how to send a message directly onto someone's voicemail. You can designate your<br>message to go to the top of the recipient's voicemail list. You can also program it so that<br>the recipient cannot forward it.<br>Some systems have limits on how much space can be used for individual voicemail.<br>There are a number of courtesies that voicemail users should follow. Your greeting on<br>your voicemail should be simple, polite and clear. If you are unable to take calls for any<br>reason, you might want to explain that in your recorded greeting. If you are on vacation,<br>you might want to include that information in your greeting.<br>Don't use voicemail as a way to avoid answering the telephone. Some people use<br>voicemail to screen calls; this can be annoying to someone who can never contact you<br>directly. Check your messages regularly and reply to them promptly. Enjoy the<br>telecommunications revolution!<br>",

          "The state of Texas is famous for having the biggest and best of everything. Before Alaska<br>became a state, Texas was the largest American state. It was also famous for its huge<br>cattle ranches. Cotton is a major crop, but much of the wealth comes from oil and gas.<br>People think of Texans as being wealthy because there have been lots of cattle and oil<br>millionaires.<br>In the late nineteenth century, Texas cattlemen used to drive their herds north to Kansas.<br>There a train to the east shipped the cows. Eventually, the railroad came to Texas and the<br>great cattle drive stopped. By then, many Texans owned large ranches and were quite<br>wealthy.<br>In the twentieth century, oil has made many Texans wealthy. Oil refining has led to<br>chemical industries and synthetic products. Most Texans now live in cities. Many oil<br>companies have their headquarters in Dallas. Other large manufacturing cities are<br>Houston, Corpus Christi, Fort Worth and Austin, which is the Capital of Texas.<br>Several cities, such as San Antonio and El Paso, have a strong Spanish influence. This<br>dates back to the first Spanish visitors in the sixteenth century. The old mission at San<br>Antonio is famous as the Alamo, where an important battle for Texas independence was<br>fought.<br>Texas is a huge area with mountains, deserts, prairies, rivers and islands. The rugged<br>beauty of its grasslands and deserts attracts many tourists. For a state that is mostly dry,<br>Texas has a remarkable variety of wildflowers in the spring. Its animals and birds differ<br>from other parts of the U.S.A. Texas has the armored insect eater, the Armadillo; the swift<br>running bird, the Roadrunner; prairie dogs, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, wild pigs, horned<br>lizards, and one hundred species of snakes! As might be expected also, it has many<br>beautiful kinds of cacti and other desert plants.<br>At its largest, Texas is more than 600 miles wide by 600 miles long. Such a large area<br>develops a distinct culture of its own. And Texans are widely recognized by their accent<br>and manner of speaking, their attitudes and interests and their sense of independence<br>and self-reliance.<br>Texas is also known for its beautiful women, who regularly win national beauty contests.<br>Its men have a reputation for being rugged, for not talking more than they have to and for<br>being straightforward and honest.<br>Although many people think of cowboys and Indians when they think of Texas, it is a<br>center for high-tech industries. The American space program has its headquarters in<br>Houston, and Mission Control Center is there. Texas is also an important manufacturer of<br>computers and other high tech products.<br>Oil production is still important in Texas, but it ranks third as a source of revenue behind<br>manufacturing and tourism. The colorful history of Texas and its wonderful scenery<br>contribute to a thriving tourist industry. Texas is also an important business and financial<br>area. Yes, even though times have changed, Texans proudly maintain that their state still<br>has the biggest and the best of everything.<br>",

        Content:
          "Businessmen often complain that their profits are negatively affected by government<br>regulations. On the other hand, history has proven that it is necessary to regulate<br>business in at least one area--public safety. There is ample evidence that consideration<br>for the safety of the public is not always a priority in business decisions.<br>Back in 1912, the Titanic smashed into an iceberg, killing hundreds of people. It was<br>going too fast through a large collection of icebergs, while attempting to set a speed<br>record. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate the passengers.<br>Usually when such a tragedy occurs, the company is not found guilty. Instead, safety<br>regulations are enacted for future cases. In the future, ships were ordered to carry a<br>sufficient supply of lifeboats.<br>In 1978, the Ford Motor Company was indicted on the charge of homicide. This was the<br>first time such a charge had been brought against an American corporation. It related to<br>the deaths of three teenage girls who were burned up when their Ford Pinto was hit from<br>behind. The prosecution charged that the Ford Company knowingly manufactured a<br>dangerous car.<br>Behind this story is the pressure on Ford to produce a small car to compete with<br>imported vehicles. The Pinto was rushed into production in spite of warnings that the<br>gas tank was in a dangerous position. It would have cost Ford an additional $11.00 per<br>car to fix the problem. Ford decided not to.<br>Later, Ford produced a cost-benefit analysis to justify their position. Estimating that the<br>faulty design would cause 180 additional deaths, Ford valued these at $200,000 per<br>person. This cost was far less than equipping 12.5 million vehicles with $11.00 protectors.<br>So Ford felt that they had made the right decision.<br>Ford executives were acquitted on the charge of homicide. Nonetheless, Ford had to pay<br>out millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements. These were paid to families who had<br>lost relatives in Pinto accidents.<br>This case shows how far a company will go to protect its profits. For more than eight<br>years, Ford lobbied the government not to tighten safety standards on cars. As long as<br>the Pinto was profitable, Ford did not want to change the design. Although Ford made a<br>lot of money on the Pinto, their reputation was tarnished.<br>The Fort Pinto case is one of many which point to the need for governments to set safety<br>standards. No business wants to recall its products, or leave them sitting idly in a<br>warehouse, or expend large sums of money for upgrading and repairs. No airplane<br>company wants to have its planes in the hangar when they could be in the air making<br>money for the corporation. As a result, commercial companies are seldom motivated to<br>look closely at product or service safety. This is especially true today when the @x@bottom<br>line@x@ in business is seen as a justification for every decision. For this reason,<br>governments have to oversee issues of public safety. Most businesses are too busy<br>working on profits to have much time or concern for doing so.<br>",

        Content:
          "When Christopher Columbus sailed west from Spain in 1492, he was trying to reach the<br>Spice Islands (which today are called Indonesia). Spices were very scarce and valuable<br>in Europe at this time. No one knew that two vast oceans and the American continents<br>lay between Europe and Asia. Columbus did not find spices in America, but he did bring<br>home some gold trinkets. The American Indians wore these as jewellery. Gold, not spices,<br>was to become the biggest motive for exploration.<br>Expeditions into the interior of the Americas were very costly and very risky. Only by<br>promising the authorities huge profits could sailors and soldiers raise money for their<br>expeditions. They also needed to promise rich rewards in order to get followers and<br>crews. If a leader returned to Europe without gold and jewels, he might end up in jail. No<br>wonder the Spanish conquerors were always searching for gold.<br>At first, the Spaniards stayed around the coasts of the Caribbean Sea, but stories of gold<br>in the interior tempted them to explore inland. They asked the Indians where their gold<br>jewellery came from. The Indians would point further inland. They said that a wealthy<br>people lived in the high mountains that traded gold and emeralds for pearls, cotton and<br>shells.<br>The Spanish Emperor had given the rights to exploit present-day Venezuela and<br>Colombia to his German bankers in 1528. So Germans--Dalfinger, Federmann and<br>Hohermuth--led a series of expeditions into the jungles, grasslands and mountains.<br>Meanwhile, Spanish conquerors had found immense riches in gold and silver. Hernando<br>Cortes had captured the Kingdom of the Aztecs in Mexico in 1519. He had sent immense<br>treasures to Europe. Soon after this, Francesco Pizarro began to explore the west coast<br>of South America. In 1531, Pizarro invaded Peru and destroyed the Kingdom of the Incas.<br>Pizarro melted down the gold and silver treasures of the Incas, and sent gold and silver<br>bricks back to Spain. The rush to find more gold became very heated.<br>Rumours came down from the mountains of Colombia about a golden man - el hombre<br>Dorado. There were stories about a king so rich that he wore gold dust instead of a coat.<br>Colombia was the Kingdom of the Chibchas. They were a trading people who traded salt<br>and emeralds for gold, cotton, pearls, and shells. The actual gold did not come from their<br>kingdom. It was found in the mountain rivers, and brought to the Chibchas for refining<br>and metalwork.<br>Several armies converged on Chibcha territory. The first to arrive was the Spaniard<br>Quesada, coming up the Magdalene River from the Caribbean. He found the chief cities<br>of the Chibchas and seized their gold and emeralds. Shortly afterwards, one of Pizarro's<br>captains arrived from Peru and Ecuador. Then the German Federmann arrived from<br>Venezuela. Quesada gave the latecomers some gold and jewels to ease their<br>disappointment.<br>Quesada's men also found out about the Golden Man. High in the mountains was a lake<br>created by a meteorite. The Indians believes that the 'golden god' from the sky now lived<br>at the bottom of the lake. When a new leader of the tribe was elected, he was covered in<br>grease, and fine gold dust was blown over his body so that he appeared to be made of<br>gold. He was taken out to the middle of the lake on a raft. He would jump into the lake,<br>and stay in the water till the gold dust was washed off. It was considered an offering to<br>the god. Gold ornaments were also tossed in the lake. Then the king and his followers<br>would return to the shore. This ceremony was stopped several generations before the<br>Europeans arrived.<br>Many people were unwilling to believe that this was the whole story. They began to<br>search for a golden city hidden in the jungle. Many explorers perished in this search.<br>In their search for gold, the Spanish conquerors destroyed the great Indian civilizations<br>of America. Towns and villages had been ruined, thousands of people killed and<br>wonderful pieces of art melted down. Some Indians believed that gold must be a food<br>that Europeans desperately needed to stay alive. In many cases, the Europeans<br>destroyed the trading and social systems that had produced their wealth. When we think<br>about the great achievements of a few conquerors and explorers, we are also sad about<br>how much death and damage they caused.<br>",

        Content:
          "The Grand Canyon is one of the most spectacular sights in nature. It is found in one<br>section of the valley of the Colorado River. The river begins its course high in the Rocky<br>Mountains of the State of Colorado. The river travels a total of 1,400 miles through<br>Colorado, Utah and Arizona and into the Gulf of California. It forms part of Arizona's<br>border with Nevada and California.<br>The Colorado River is a very swift and muddy river. It carries dirt and rocks down from<br>the mountains. The story is told of an old fur trader who was attacked by Indians high up<br>the river. His only escape was down the Colorado River in a small boat. It was a terrifying<br>trip through rapids and around rocks at top speed. The fur trader was found some days<br>later in very rough shape hundreds of miles down the river. No one would believe that he<br>had come so far so fast.<br>The Grand Canyon stretches for about 250 miles in the State of Arizona. The canyon was<br>carved out by the flow of the river itself. In places the canyon is more than a mile deep. It<br>stretches from four to 18 miles wide at the top. The canyon valley contains worn rocks<br>that rise up like a mountain range. The canyon has been worn down through many layers<br>of rock. The river has cut its way down through layers of sandstone, limestone and<br>shape to the granite bedrock. The different layers are of different colours, and the rocks<br>appear very beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset.<br>Because the canyon is so deep, the climate changes as you go down into the valley. At<br>the top, the climate is typical of a mountain area, with evergreen trees. Next, you have<br>typical forest trees. Third, there are plants like cacti that grow in warm deserts. Finally,<br>there are sub-tropical plants at the valley bottom.<br>Tourists can ride down the narrow trails to the bottom of the valley on mules. On one<br>side is the rock wall of the canyon, and on the other side is a steep drop down to the<br>bottom. Tourists have to trust their guide, and the mule that they are riding, to get them<br>down safely. The trails zigzag back and forth, and the tourist going down travels much<br>more than a mile. Some 1,000 square miles of the area became the Grand Canyon<br>National Park in 1919.<br>Because the Colorado River is very swift and runs through dry country, several dams<br>have been built along it. These are designed to harness its power, save its water and<br>provide recreational opportunities. The best-known dam is Hoover Dam, formerly<br>Boulder Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border. This impressive structure is 727 feet high,<br>and 1,282 feet long. Elevators are used to carry workers up and down inside the dam.<br>The water, which is backed up by the Hoover Dam, forms Lake Mead. Lake Mead is used<br>to irrigate nearby land, as well as for boating and fishing. The dam itself is a major<br>source of electric power for this section of the country.<br>Visitors to the Grand Canyon are often filled with awe by the size and beauty of the<br>canyon. People seem very small in comparison to the immense cliffs, valleys and the<br>mighty river.<br>",

        Content:
          "Niagara Falls, Canada, became a major tourist attraction in the mid-1830s. By this time,<br>roads, canals and railways were able to bring people from urban centers, like New York<br>and Boston. However, the chance for big profits attracted dishonest businessmen. One<br>hotel in the 1860s was popularly known as the @x@Cave of the Forty Thieves.@x@<br>There were many complaints from tourists about tricks that were used to get their money.<br>Some businessmen tried to put up fences around the Falls, so that all visitors would<br>have to pay them to see the Falls. In time, these complaints reached the ears of important<br>people. In 1873, Lord Dufferin, the Governor-General of Canada, proposed that the<br>government buy all the land around the Falls. On the American side, New York State<br>bought 412 acres around the American Rainbow Falls in 1885. In the same year, land was<br>bought near the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and named Queen Victoria Park. A<br>commission was formed to obtain control of all land along the Niagara River. This was<br>made easier because a narrow strip along the river was already government land.<br>However, the Commission wanted to preserve all the beautiful scenery along the river<br>and near the Falls for the general public. The first commissioner of the parks was Sir<br>Casimir Gzowski, a distinguished engineer of Polish birth.<br>Before the Queen Victoria Park Commission began to buy up land besides the Falls,<br>tourists had to pay for everything. There were no public washrooms, no drinking<br>fountains, and no safety barriers around the Falls. As a result, it was not uncommon for<br>tourists crowding close to the Falls, or hypnotized by the flow of the river, to step too<br>close and fall in. The commission took care of these problems and also set up parks and<br>picnic areas. In 1927, the Commission's name was changed to the Niagara Parks<br>Commission. It now supervises numerous attractions and parks from Niagara-on-the-<br>Lake on Lake Ontario, down to Fort Erie on Lake Erie. Each section of the 56-kilometer<br>stretch of Niagara Parks has its own places of interest. These are joined by the Niagara<br>Parkway, a road that runs the whole length of the river. Sir Winston Churchill called the<br>parkway, @x@The prettiest Sunday afternoon drive in the world.@x@<br>The Niagara Parks Commission operates restaurants, parks and gardens, rides,<br>museums and historic houses, golf courses, native sites and gift shops. Near the Falls<br>are restaurants, parks, greenhouses, the @x@Journey Behind the Falls@x@ and the @x@Maid of the<br>Mist@x@ boat ride. North of the Falls, at Niagara Gorge, are the Spanish Aero Car Ride and<br>the Great Gorge Adventure. The Commission also operates a School of Horticulture, with<br>large gardens. Queenston Heights is a park commemorating one of Canada's heroes,<br>General Isaac Brock. In nearby Queenston are historic houses connected with two other<br>important Canadians, Laura Secord and William Lyon MacKenzie. The Commission also<br>operates two historic forts, dating from the War of 1812 - Fort George and Old Fort Erie.<br>The Niagara Parks Commission has played a major role in making Niagara Falls and the<br>Niagara River one of the leading tourist areas in the world. The Commission shows how<br>governments can work to make visits to natural wonders like Niagara Falls a good<br>experience for the general public.<br>",

        Title: "The Welland Canal",
        Content:
          "Before railways and automobiles became common, transporting goods over long<br>distances was a difficult chore. In early North America, roads were often bad or non-<br>existent. In the winter, snow and cold weather made travel difficult. Frontier farmers had<br>trouble selling their crops because it was hard to get them to the cities.<br>Often rivers and lakes were the best ways to travel. Fur traders carried their furs and<br>other supplies in canoes. But even large canoes were not big enough to hold a shipment<br>of wheat. Rapids and waterfalls meant that goods had to be taken out of the canoe and<br>carried to the next body of calm water.<br>One way to improve water transportation was to build a canal. In New York State,<br>Governor DeWitt Clinton had constructed the Erie Canal from the Niagara River to the<br>Hudson River, soon after the War of 1812.<br>Because relations between the United States and Canada were still not very friendly, this<br>was another reason to build a canal on the Canadian side. Canals could be used to move<br>supplies and troops during wartime. Sometimes the British government would forbid<br>Canadian farmers to sell food to the U.S.A. Without a canal to move their farm produce,<br>crops were sometimes left to rot.<br>A St. Catharines, Ontario, merchant named William Hamilton Merritt thought about all<br>these things in the 1820s. He also thought that flourmills needed a more reliable source<br>of water to operate.<br>St. Catharines is on Twelve-Mile Creek below the Niagara Escarpment. This creek runs<br>towards Lake Ontario. It rises above the Escarpment, which stands from 150 to 300 feet<br>high, then runs towards Lake Ontario. If Merritt could join the Twelve-Mile Creek to one of<br>the rivers, which ran to Lake Erie, the canal would provide transportation and waterpower.<br>The problem was to find a way to move boats up the escarpment.<br>From 1824 to 1829, Merritt and his friends hired labourers to dig away tons of dirt and<br>rock. Nearly all the work was done with shovels, pickaxes, horses and wagons. In places,<br>the ground was soft and landslides occurred. In other places, the men had to dig through<br>solid granite rock.<br>Merritt's main problem, however, was raising the money to pay for the construction. After<br>sinking all the money that he, his family and friends had into the canal, more was needed.<br>Merritt went to Toronto, New York and finally London, England to get the financial<br>support he needed.<br>The problem of getting the boats to climb the escarpment was solved by a series of 35<br>wooden locks. These carried a ship 327 feet upwards. The ship would enter a lock with a<br>small amount of water. More water would come into the lock, lifting the boat another ten<br>or fifteen feet. Then the ship would move into the next lock, and be lifted up again. Boats<br>going in the opposite direction were lowered instead of lifted.<br>The Welland Canal has been rebuilt three times since the first canal opened in 1829. Now<br>large sea-going and lake vessels cross the Niagara Peninsula from Lake Ontario to Lake<br>Erie. They carry grain, coal, iron ore, oil and many other bulk products. The Welland<br>Canal remains one of the most important commercial waterways in the world.<br>",

          "Wal-Mart is now the world's largest retail organization. Wal-Mart employs around 1.2<br>million people worldwide. In 2000, Wal-Mart had sales of more than $191 billion, with<br>profits of $6.3 billion. Profits increased 16% from the previous year.<br>People have come to expect that Wal-Mart's profits will increase substantially every year.<br>Each year more stores are opened, and Wal-Mart expands into new countries. Wal-Mart<br>also enters new areas of business nearly every year. Few people know that Wal-Mart is<br>also a major real estate company.<br>Sam Walton opened his Walton's Five and Dime in Bentonville, Arkansas, in 1950. Twelve<br>years later he opened the first Wal-Mart in Bentonville. His business philosophy was<br>simple-- good prices, great selection and a friendly greeting. Walton was known for the<br>@x@Ten Foot Attitude.@x@ This means that any employee should greet any customer who is<br>within ten feet of them. He emphasized that it is important to speak to people before they<br>speak to you. Walton also believed that good deals from suppliers should be passed<br>along to customers. The combination of low prices and friendly service is basic to Wal-<br>Mart's success. That one store in Bentonville has become 4,203 stores in the U.S.A., plus<br>another 1,000 outside the United States.<br>Walton died in 1992, but his business philosophy continues to be preached at Wal-Marts.<br>Each store has greeters who meet the customers at the door, and deal with any special<br>needs they have. Having greeters gives the effect of having more service clerks than<br>Wal-Mart really has. Compared to some other department stores, Wal-Mart has relatively<br>fewer employees.<br>Wal-Mart also has the Wal-Mart Foundation, which sponsors numerous good causes.<br>Among their programs are high school scholarship, fundraising for local hospitals and<br>sick children, environmental concerns and community @x@matching grant' outreach.<br>So, what's not to like about Wal-Mart? The main complaint is that their business style is<br>extremely aggressive. Wal-Mart's attitudes towards manufacturers and suppliers are:<br>@x@You do it our way, or we won't do business with you.@x@ This puts Wal-Mart at an<br>advantage over smaller retailers who don't have the same retailing power. Wal-Mart has<br>been known to demand that its suppliers provide products at discount for Wal-Mart store<br>openings; levy fines for shipment errors; tell manufacturers what products, styles and<br>colours to make, etc. Wal-Mart expects product delivery in two days, and expects<br>manufacturers to cooperate with its promotional and retailing strategies. In effect, any<br>company that works with Wal-Mart becomes one of their employees.<br>Any company, which so dominates one area of the market, will have a lot of power. So far,<br>Wal-Mart has been successful in getting what it wants, and providing customers with<br>what they want.<br>",

In Yellowstone<br>National Park, however, there is a large area of land, which indicates recent volcanic<br>activity. This area contains hot springs, geysers and mud springs.<br>Hot springs, like geysers, are caused by underground water being heated by hot rocks<br>down in the earth. This hot water is then forced to the surface. When the surface rock is<br>soft or porous, then the hot water bubbles up like a spring. When the surface rock is hard,<br>then the hot water shoots up through any hole in the rock that it can find. These spurts of<br>hot water are called geysers. Yellowstone also contains mud pots or mud springs. These<br>happen when the hot water is turned to steam, and the steam carries mud and clay to the<br>surface.<br>Yellowstone Park is high up in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming. Very few white people<br>went there until the 1860s. It is said that Indians avoided the area because they thought<br>that evil spirits lived there.<br>In 1869, three men from Montana decided to explore this remote area. They were very<br>impressed with its natural wonders and talked about it to others. Two other exploring<br>expeditions followed in the next two years. These visitors were so enthusiastic about the<br>beauty and majesty of Yellowstone that they asked that it be made a national park. At that<br>time, there was no national park system in America. Nonetheless, in 1872, the American<br>government agreed to set aside these lands as a public park.<br>Why were the early visitors to Yellowstone so impressed? First, the scenery is<br>spectacular. The Yellowstone River has created its own Grand Canyon through years of<br>eroding its rocky banks. It is the yellow colour of these canyon walls that gave<br>Yellowstone its name. The area has many waterfalls, including the 308-foot high Lower<br>Falls in the Yellowstone River. There are many beautiful lakes, and the largest is<br>Yellowstone Lake.<br>",

        Content:
          "In North America, most colleges and universities, as well as many high schools, have a<br>student newspaper. These newspapers focus on happenings at the school. They inform<br>the student population about activities on campus and often include world news, which<br>is relevant to student interests. In addition, there are opinion pieces by the student<br>editors, which reflect their views on the school and the world. Sometimes these editorials<br>oppose the way that the school is being run. Occasionally, school officials will try to shut<br>down or censor student papers, if they find their writing embarrassing or offensive. But<br>usually these disagreements are resolved by discussion.<br>At some colleges, the student newspaper is connected to a professional program in<br>journalism. But, most of the time, the idea behind the paper is to get students to research<br>the facts, debate the issues, and learn how to get their opinions expressed. If these<br>students go on to become professional journalists that is fine, but it is not really<br>expected.<br>You might wonder whether enough things happen at a college to fill out a weekly paper.<br>Yes, indeed! Schools and universities reflect the real world. There are often problems<br>with the budget and cuts to programs. New buildings go up, or are torn down. Policies<br>change; tuition goes up; classrooms become crowded; and personnel come and go.<br>University morale and funding often reflect government policies and social attitudes.<br>These tie the college to the larger world. Editorials often comment on how national and<br>world events affect the university.<br>At the same time, there are many things going on within the university. Construction<br>disturbs classes; offices are broken into; computers are stolen; accidents happen in the<br>parking lot; students die on the roads during the holidays; sports teams win or lose;<br>graduation takes place; students and instructors win awards; plays are put on;<br>distinguished visitors speak; rock bands are in concert.<br>Then there is always the question of student rights and responsibilities. What kinds of<br>student behavior are unacceptable? Should the university pay attention to student<br>activities off-campus? Committees meet, with student representation, to set guidelines<br>for these matters.<br>Another issue is who sets the agenda for the university. Corporate sponsors today are<br>buying exclusive rights to distribute their products on campus. Governments are<br>expecting universities to follow official policies in order to receive funding. Social groups<br>are demanding that university policies reflect their special interests.<br>So there is no shortage of topics for student journalists to address. Of course, they also<br>write about everything that young people are interested in - music, movies, computers,<br>sports, travel and pop culture. Student newspapers are an important training group for<br>democracy. They are also very interesting to read.<br>",

This means that there is considerable uniformity<br>regarding programs, administration and policy. Private colleges tend to be smaller and<br>are mostly based on a religious curriculum.<br>Most universities offer programs in the Humanities, Social Sciences and pure Sciences.<br>Many have additional faculties such as Education and Physical Education. Many<br>programs that lead directly to a position in the workplace are given at community<br>colleges. Community colleges differ from universities because their programs involve<br>job training and practical experience. For example, they might offer courses in areas<br>such as computer programming, journalism, photography, social work, dentistry and<br>nursing. Their programs are considered to be less abstract and academic than university<br>programs.<br>Many students see university as being more fun than community college. They don't<br>have to worry immediately about getting a job, and the social life is often better at<br>university. However, a university degree may be less likely to lead directly to a job.<br>Nowadays, university programs, which are work-related, such as business<br>administration, education, child studies and psychology, seem especially popular.<br>Universities, however, were founded mainly as liberal arts institutions. This means that<br>their original intent was to prepare people to be well-rounded human beings and<br>knowledgeable citizens. So nearly all universities have programs in literature, languages,<br>philosophy, culture, music, history and politics, as well as studies that are more job-<br>related.<br>A pass B.A. or B.Sc. degree in Canada is normally three full years of study after<br>secondary school. A bachelor degree with honours includes one more year of study. A<br>Master's degree is a further one or two years. A doctorate usually requires four or more<br>years. This is similar to the United States, except that their bachelor degree is normally<br>three years, and their master's degree may be up to three years.<br>To gain entrance to university you usually need to graduate from secondary school with<br>a B average. Some programs will require an A average. Tuition costs have gone up in<br>recent years as governments have handed over less money to colleges and universities.<br>More students now have to work during the school year to pay their expenses.<br>Attending college and university is known to be one of the most carefree periods in a<br>person's life. As long as you keep up with your readings and assignments, you should be<br>able to avoid major difficulties. Facilities for athletics, student radio and newspapers,<br>pubs and lounges and generally pleasant surroundings make campus life agreeable. It is<br>a good time to make friends, learn new skills and take calculated risks.

Many coffee shops are<br>open 24 hours a day, including Sundays and holidays. That way, people who work at<br>night or who have trouble sleeping can drop in at any time.<br>Because coffee and donuts are relatively inexpensive, people feel comfortable sitting for<br>a while, knowing that they are not spending a lot of money. Although coffee and donuts<br>are the main items sold at coffee shops, many also serve other beverages and desserts,<br>and sometimes a light lunch. Many patrons have a favourite kind of coffee or other drink<br>and will drive past other coffee shops to go to one that serves the flavour they like.<br>Visitors from other countries are often surprised at how roomy these coffee shops can<br>be. Some are as large as regular restaurants. Having a nice bit of space around them<br>encourages people to relax. Some people arrange regular dates and meet every day, or<br>every week, at the same time. For example, retired friends may get together every<br>weekday morning at 10:00 am.

Even people who have coffee machines at home or at work like to go to<br>coffee shops to get a special kind of coffee or a favourite treat.<br>It might seem that the business owners would not make much money just selling a few<br>items, but in fact, many coffee shops do extremely well, especially if they are located in a<br>busy traffic area.

They charted the seas, mapped out distant countries and studied plants, animals<br>and people. They also claimed many lands for England. This kind of international travel<br>was made easier by improved transportation and communication. New inventions such<br>as steamships, trains, telegraphs and telephones made long distances seem smaller.<br>Of course, people had different reasons for going to distant lands. Some were<br>businessmen who saw economic opportunities overseas. Soldiers wanted fame and a<br>chance to enlarge the British Empire. Big-game hunters wanted to be the first to shoot<br>strange animals and bring back trophies to England. Scientists intended to study<br>unknown animals and plants. Missionaries planned to be the first to introduce<br>Christianity to faraway people.<br>In 1836 a young Scotsman called David Livingstone began to study medicine in Glasgow.<br>Livingstone intended to become a medical missionary. This means that he would be a<br>doctor, as well as a preacher and teacher.<br>Livingstone (1813-1873) came from a poor family. From an early age, he had worked 14<br>hours a day in a clothing factory for very little pay. But he was determined to learn. He<br>took his books with him to the factory and read as he worked. Then, after work, he would<br>go to his teacher to learn more.<br>Livingstone's goal was to teach faraway people about Jesus. However, unlike some<br>missionaries, he was also interested in science, geography and exploring. He had<br>planned to go to China in 1839, but because of the Opium Wars no missionaries were<br>being sent there. Instead, he asked to go to South Africa.<br>Europeans had traveled around the coasts of Africa for hundreds of years. But very few<br>white people had traveled inland. A missionary named Robert Moffatt who had begun a<br>mission at Kuruman in the interior inspired Livingstone.<br>Livingstone arrived in Kuruman in 1841. This was the farthest outpost of white settlement,<br>and no one seemed to want to go further inland. Livingstone felt that the missionaries<br>should go to the Africans, rather than waiting for the Africans to come to them. With a<br>fellow missionary he set out. When they came to an African tribe, they would talk to the<br>chief and ask permission to preach to his people. Livingstone would also set up a tent<br>and treat the people who had diseases. After a while, he would move on to the next tribe.<br>Once Livingstone learned the Bantu language he would talk to many Africans. But<br>sometimes he needed interpreters. There were many diseases, including malaria and<br>sleeping sickness. Livingstone suffered much of his life from river fever. He was also so<br>weak that he rode on the back of an ox.<br>Livingstone wanted to stop the slave trade. At this time, the slave trade was the most<br>profitable business in Africa. Livingstone hoped that if other kinds of trade were<br>developed, then slavery could be abolished. In order to open up trade, he wanted to find<br>an easy route into the center of Africa.<br>Livingstone kept going further into the interior. He was probably the first European to<br>cross the Kalahari Desert before reaching Lake Ngami in present-day Botswana. Not long<br>after, he traveled further inland. He explored the sources of the Zambesi and Kasai rivers<br>and eventually reached the west coast of Africa at Luanda, Angola.<br>Livingstone was being criticized for neglecting missionary work in order to explore.<br>Livingstone replied that he was opening up the continent for missionaries. Meanwhile, he<br>was becoming famous as a great explorer.<br>The British government commissioned him to explore the Zambesi River. They hoped<br>that ships could sail up the river into the interior. Unfortunately, the Zambesi had too<br>many rapids. However, Livingstone did find a route up the Shire River to Lake Nyassa. He<br>continued to struggle against the slave trade, which was now being taken over by Arabs.<br>Livingstone died in Africa in 1873. He was the first white man to explore Botswana,<br>Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and surrounding areas. He was not only a great explorer, but<br>also a fine doctor and a good missionary. Nowadays, the countries that Livingstone<br>visited are nearly all Christian--just as he hoped they would be.<br>",

Oreos were good to dunk in a drink, to eat<br>whole, to eat in parts, or to use in cooking. Oreos have become both America's and the<br>world's favourite commercial cookie. New varieties of Oreos are added regularly to the<br>original product.<br>Although commercial biscuits like Oreos are very popular, many people prefer home-<br>baked ones. In fact, there is a whole line of commercial cookies called @x@home-style,@x@<br>which try to imitate homemade cookies. The most popular cookie in America can be<br>either bought in a package or baked at home. These are chocolate chip cookies.<br>Ruth and Kenneth Wakefield operated the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts.<br>One day in 1930, Mrs. Wakefield ran out of baking chocolate for her baking cookies. She<br>broke up a chocolate bar and added the pieces to her cookie mix. She expected that the<br>chocolate bits would melt into the dough when she baked them. But they didn't. Soon<br>chocolate chip cookies were being made commercially by adding small chunks of<br>chocolate to regular chocolate cookie dough. Lots of people like to make their own by<br>adding commercial chocolate chips to their dough.<br>Now chocolate chip cookies are the most popular kind of cookie in North America. Over<br>seven billion are eaten annually here. Half of all the cookies baked in American homes<br>are chocolate chip cookies.<br>Experiments in baking and packaging have led to new kinds of cookies. Recently, soft<br>cookies have become very popular. Since they are packaged in foil, they can stay fresh<br>and soft for many months. It seems likely that the love of cookies will be around for a<br>long time.<br>",

        Content:
          "It could be said that Florence Nightingale was responsible for inventing modern nursing.<br>Indeed, Nightingale did open up the professions to women generally. Her example and<br>influence during the mid to late nineteenth Century were an important factor in opening<br>doors to women.<br>Nightingale's own life reflects many of these changes. She was born in 1820, and was<br>one of two daughters of a wealthy English family. Her mother was a beautiful society lady<br>who had once turned down a favoured suitor because he was not wealthy enough. She<br>wanted both her daughters to be socially popular and to marry rich and important men.<br>Florence's father ensured that she had a good education. But she was frustrated<br>because girls and women were always under parental supervision. She felt called to a life<br>of action, but her family insisted that she divide her time between being with her family<br>and attending social functions. She was not allowed to do anything on her own.<br>When she was 16, Nightingale said that God spoke to her and called her to do His work.<br>But Florence didn't know what work she was being called to do. Years passed away while<br>she sat with her mother and sister, or attended dances and concerts or travelled to<br>Europe.<br>Nightingale became more angry and rebellious. She offended her family and friends by<br>refusing to marry several prominent men who wanted to marry her. By the time she was<br>24, she had decided to be a nurse.<br>But how did one become a nurse? At that time, the profession didn't seem promising.<br>The only respectable nurses were those women in religious orders that ministered to the<br>patient's spiritual health, but were not trained in medicine. The majority of nurses were<br>poor, untrained women who were suspected of being too fond of men or alcohol, or both.<br>In fact, one hospital preferred to hire unwed mothers as nurses because they had no<br>reputations to lose.<br>Nightingale's family was horrified by her plans. Their opposition delayed her plans but<br>could not stop them. In 1850 she visited a hospital in Germany for the first time. In 1853,<br>she was appointed superintendent of a women's nursing home in London. But, Florence<br>was still waiting for her true calling.<br>In 1855, the Times of London was printing reports from the Crimean War. France and<br>England were fighting Russia in the Crimean Peninsula. After one allied victory, the<br>wounded French soldiers were well taken care of, but the wounded English soldiers were<br>left to die. Back in England there was a public outcry. It was Florence's opportunity. She<br>was soon on her way to Istanbul, Turkey, with 38 nurses.<br>Scutari, Turkey, was the hospital where the British wounded were brought. This so-called<br>hospital was a death pit, where 42 out of every 100 men died. The army was unwilling to<br>listen to Miss Nightingale or to let her tend the wounded. She had to wait until conditions<br>became so bad that the regular medical officers were overwhelmed. As soon as the army<br>turned to her, she immediately went to work. She had the entire hospital cleaned, a new<br>kitchen set up, and a good water supply obtained. The death rate dropped to 22 out of<br>every 1,000. Nightingale became famous overnight.<br>Although her efforts in the Crimean War injured her health, she continued her work back<br>in London. She published a 1,000-page report on medical conditions in the British Army,<br>several books on nursing and her own proposals and suggestions. She also set up a<br>training school for nurses. Long before her death in 1910, she had seen nursing become<br>a well-established profession. Almost single-handedly she had helped to bring about<br>proper treatment of the sick and injured.<br>",

        Title: "Harriet Tubman",
        Content:
          "Before the American Civil War, the economy of the Southern States was based on the use<br>of slave labour. The social and political leaders of the Old South were the plantation<br>owners. Many of these owned hundreds of black slaves. The slaves were mainly used to<br>pick crops like cotton and tobacco.<br>Harriet Tubman was born in 1820 in the State of Maryland. As a girl of seven, she was<br>sent into the fields to work with the adult slaves. The slaves worked from sunrise to<br>sunset picking the crops. Often they sang songs while they worked.<br>Slaves were not taught to read or write. It was feared that reading and writing would help<br>slaves to escape the plantations. Harriet Tubman was illiterate. Later in life, when she<br>was in danger of being captured, she picked up a book and pretended to read it. This<br>fooled the bounty hunters.<br>When she was 15, Harriet helped another slave to escape. The overseer was so angry<br>with her that he hit her over the head with an iron weight. Harriet was knocked<br>unconscious for many days. All the rest of her life she suffered from headaches and<br>sudden sleeping spells.<br>Harriet escaped from the plantation to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since Pennsylvania<br>was not a slave state, Harriet was fairly safe there. She was able to return secretly to the<br>plantation and bring the rest of her family to freedom.<br>There were already people working to bring black slaves up from the South to freedom.<br>These people, both white and black, used the language of the railroad. Escaped slaves<br>were called passengers, safe houses were called stations, and the guides were called<br>conductors. Harriet soon became a conductor in the Underground Railway.<br>In 1850, the American government passed a second Fugitive Slave Act. This put more<br>pressure on Northern States to return escaped slaves to the South. Because of this, the<br>Underground Railway went further north to Canada.<br>In 1793, Upper Canada (Ontario) had passed a law, bringing a gradual stop to slavery. In<br>1834, slavery was abolished in the whole British Empire. A lot of escaped slaves had<br>come to Canada before 1850, but now nearly all escaped slaves tried to go there.<br>Harriet Tubman rented a house in St. Catharines, Ontario. This provided a shelter for new<br>arrivals. Harriet made about eleven trips from Canada to the U.S.A. during these years. In<br>all, she brought back about 300 people.<br>Escaped slaves had to travel by night and suffered hardships in bad weather. They had<br>to hide during the day wherever they could. Harriet did not allow any passengers to turn<br>back. That might endanger the whole Underground Railway.<br>When the slave owners heard about Harriet, they offered a reward for her capture. But no<br>one caught her, or turned her in. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, she acted as a<br>spy for the Northern States. After the war, she married a black American soldier, Nelson<br>Davis. In 1869, a book was written about Harriet Tubman.<br>Black slaves knew Harriet as @x@Moses.@x@ The Bible tells the store of how Moses led the<br>people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt. He led them north to Palestine. In the same way,<br>Harriet Tubman delivered many of her people from slavery and led them north to freedom.<br>",

        Content:
          "A hernia occurs when there is a tear or weakness in the muscle layers of the abdomen.<br>This allows the intestines to push forward into the gap. Usually the person feels some<br>discomfort, and may notice an egg-shaped swelling. In a few cases, the muscle layers<br>may clamp down on the protruding intestine, and cut off its oxygen supply. This can<br>result in death, if medical help is not readily available.<br>Hernias are more common in men than women, and are often related to lifting heavy<br>materials. Although most hernias are not a serious threat to health, they usually get<br>worse over time. The only cure is surgery to repair the cut, tear or weakness.<br>As with any surgery, time in hospital is usually required for recovery. This proved to be a<br>problem in Canada during World War II. Many young men were declared unfit for military<br>service because they had hernias. During the war, there was a shortage of doctors and<br>beds for hernia repair.<br>A Toronto doctor, Dr. Edward Shouldice, decided to address this problem. He personally<br>operated on seventy of these young men, using a technique of his own. This @x@Shouldice<br>Technique@x@ allowed the patients a quicker recovery time than the usual method. It also<br>had a much lower rate of complications and failures.<br>After the war, Dr. Shouldice opened his own hernia clinic for the public. In 1953, a second<br>hospital was started in Thornhill, just north of Toronto, and today all surgery is done<br>there.<br>The Shouldice Hospital is located on a beautiful piece of land with a valley on one side<br>and a golf course on the other. The large grounds have wonderful gardens and flowering<br>trees. There are nature paths for patients to walk on. The building itself is not a regular<br>hospital, but more like a hotel or residence, where patients can play the piano, shoot pool,<br>play shuffleboard, or practice their putting.<br>The hospital now has 89 beds, and an average of 30 hernia operations are performed<br>daily. Since all the surgeons are specialists, their level of skill is very high, and less than<br>1% of operations need to be corrected. (The worldwide rate of failure is around 20%.)<br>For patients, the good news is that everything at the hospital is directed to repairing their<br>hernia, and aiding their recovery as quickly as possible. The staff encourages its patients<br>to walk and exercise within four or five hours of surgery. Patients usually stay on for<br>several more days, until they are fully recovered and ready to go home. Shouldice's best<br>advertisements are his satisfied customers.<br>Hernia patients come not only from Canada and the United States, but also from many<br>countries of the world to receive the best possible treatment. Shouldice remains the<br>most famous hospital in the world devoted entirely to the repair and treatment of hernias.<br>",

          "Julie Andrews, born Julia Elizabeth Wells, was born on October 1, 1935. She lived in a<br>small town called Walton-on-the-Thames in England, which is south of London. Her<br>father Ted Wells was a teacher, and mother Barbara was a pianist and piano teacher. She<br>also played piano for her sister's dancing school. Julie learned ballet and tap as a toddler<br>from her Aunt Joan Morris. By the time Julie was three, she could read and write. When<br>Julie was four, her parents divorced, and Barbara married Ted Andrews (a performer<br>during the war and an excellent tenor). He soon began giving Julie singing lessons. At<br>seven years of age, Julie had an unbelievable range of four octaves. She soon changed<br>her last name to @x@Andrews,@x@ the last name of her stepfather.<br>As she grew older, Julie became one of England's most popular performers. In early<br>childhood, Julie loved to play with her two younger half-brothers, but soon went on to<br>stardom. At age twelve, Julie was cast in a London play and stopped the show with her<br>remarkable talent. She starred in many different BBC productions during the forties.<br>Later, she starred in many Broadway plays such as The Boyfriend, My Fair Lady, and<br>Camelot. It was the latter play that Walt Disney made a special trip to New York to see,<br>and he decided then and there that Julie was perfect for the role of Mary Poppins in the<br>film of the same name. Mary Poppins was the high-spirited, magical nanny of Jane and<br>Michael Banks, two small British children. Julie also starred in many other films, such as<br>The Americanization of Emily, Hawaii, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and my personal<br>favourite, The Sound of Music. In this production she plays Maria, the lively governess of<br>Austrian Naval Captain Georg von Trapp's seven children: Liesl, Fredric, Louisa, Kurt,<br>Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. Another of Julie's talents is writing. Two of her best-known<br>books are The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles, and Mandy.<br>Julie also has five children. A daughter, Emma Kate Walton, from her marriage to Tony<br>Walton; four children from her second marriage to Blake Edwards, two of whom were<br>from Blake's previous marriage, Jennifer and Geoffrey; and two who were adopted from<br>Vietnam, Amy and Joanna.<br>In 1998, tragedy struck Julie. She lost her extraordinary talent for singing due to surgery<br>on her throat in order to remove a benign tumor.<br>A year later, she made an attempt to sing again; however, her voice will never be the<br>same. Julie has recently been on Britain's Royal Honour List and is now a Dame.<br>",

        Title: "Potato Chips and Corn Chips",
        Content:
          "The story goes that the potato chip was invented in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. in 1853. Multi-<br>millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt complained to the chef that his fried potatoes were<br>sliced too thickly. Chef George Crum responded by slicing the potatoes paper thin and<br>frying them in hot oil. The potato chip became an instant success.<br>Many companies have made large profits on chips. The most successful brands are<br>associated with the Frito-Lay Company. Herman W. Lay of Nashville, Tennessee, was<br>selling potato chips from the back of his car in the early 1930s. He soon became a<br>successful distributor for a brand of potato chips, which were made in Atlanta, Georgia.<br>When that company ran into financial problems, Lay arranged to buy them out. It now<br>became H. W. Lay and Company.<br>Meanwhile in Texas, Elmer Doolin was trying to sell chips made from corn dough. This<br>was an old Mexican recipe, which Doolin had found in San Antonio, Texas. At first, these<br>Fritos corn chips were made in Mr. Doolin's mother's kitchen. It took a few years before<br>they sold very well. Mr. Doolin moved the company to Dallas and began to expand his<br>market. In 1945, he granted the H. W. Lay Co. the rights to make Fritos corn chip for the<br>American southeast. In 1961, the two companies merged to become Frito-Lay Inc. In 1965,<br>Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi to become PepsiCo. Inc., one of the largest snack food and<br>beverage companies in the world.<br>In 2000, Frito-Lay sold 58% of all the snack chips in the U.S.A. In Canada and the United<br>States, Frito-Lay products had sales of $9.9 billion. The most popular brand was Lay's<br>potato chips, followed by Doritos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Cheetos, and Fritos. Internationally,<br>Frito-Lay has 28% of the market worldwide. That amounts to $5.9 billion annually.<br>Why are potato chips and corn chips so popular? Well, they are versatile. You can eat<br>them by themselves or with a sandwich for lunch. They can replace other forms of<br>potatoes and corn. They can also come in various flavours. For example, potato chip<br>flavours include ketchup, salt and vinegar, barbeque, dill pickle and cheddar. Potato<br>chips can be thick or thin, ridged or flat, spicy or bland. Chips can be made from many<br>things besides potatoes. There is corn dough and tortilla dough, of course. But chips can<br>also be made from sweet potatoes, parsnips, taro root, peppers and other vegetables.<br>One caution about potato chips is that they are not a good source of nutrition. Parents<br>who send their children to school with a bag of potato chips for lunch need to remember<br>that these are just a snack. Because snack chips usually contain a lot of fat, they can<br>also lead to weight gain. It is better not to eat snack chips too often, and not to eat them<br>instead of healthier foods.<br>In Canada nearly $2 billion is spent on snack food every year and half of this is spent on<br>chips. People are always looking for new flavours to try. Spicy chips are gaining in<br>popularity. The snack chip industry just keeps on growing.<br>",

          "The Shakespearean festival in Stratford, Ontario, is one of the greatest theatrical festivals<br>in the world. This is the story how this small town, which was far from any theatrical<br>centers, became so important for drama. For most of its history, Stratford was the county<br>town for the local farming region. It was also a railway center. But it was hardly known for<br>the arts.<br>An Irishman who opened an inn there founded Stratford in 1832. He called his roadhouse<br>@x@Shakespeare's Inn,@x@ after England's great dramatist. Soon the little town became known<br>as Stratford, after the town in England where Shakespeare was born. The local river was<br>likewise called the Avon after the English river.<br>The little town grew gradually and became the local center for government and law.<br>Stratford people seemed to enjoy the association with Shakespeare. Many streets were<br>given Shakespearean names such as Arden Park, Portia Boulevard, Romeo Street and<br>Viola Court. Local schools received names such as Hamlet Public School or Falstaff<br>School. Still, there was no attempt at Shakespearean theatre in Stratford, Ontario.<br>In 1913, the Canadian Pacific Railway threatened to take over the town. They proposed a<br>railway line running through the center of Stratford, which would have taken over much<br>of the town's parkland. The townspeople voted down this proposal. Instead, they<br>expanded the parkland along the Avon River. These parks were enhanced with gardens<br>and, in 1918, a pair of swans was added. These swans were an imitation of the swans on<br>English rivers.<br>In 1950, it appeared that the railway would be closing some of its workshops in Stratford.<br>The town was looking for ideas that might lead to new employment opportunities. This<br>was when one citizen, Tom Patterson, suggested that the town sponsor a drama festival.<br>Patterson was able to get Irish director, Tyrone Guthrie, to come to Stratford in 1952.<br>Guthrie agreed to head up the 1953 season. Everyone in Stratford pitched in to raise the<br>necessary money and prepare the stage. Since there was no time to put up a building,<br>the plays were staged under a huge tent. Two plays were put on during a six-week<br>season, and with great success. In 1957, a permanent theatre was built.<br>The Stratford season in 2001 runs for more than six months, from late April to early<br>November. There are fourteen plays in production at three different theatres. Altogether<br>there are 668 performances, with a total attendance of 580,000 people. About 40% of the<br>audience comes from the United States.<br>Tom Patterson's plan to ease unemployment in Stratford has worked well. The festival<br>has helped to create nearly 6,000 jobs and generate wages and salaries of $110 million<br>annually. In total, the festival brings about $170 million of revenue into the Stratford area.<br>Of course, to the audiences who come back every year, the main attraction is seeing<br>some of the best Shakespearean theatre in the world. The Stratford Festival Company is<br>Canada's leading acting company, and many of its actors have become internationally<br>known.<br>",

        Content:
          "In 1956, English writer and scientist C.P.Snow wrote an essay on @x@The Two Cultures.@x@ By<br>this, he meant that in the West there is a scientific culture and a literary culture.<br>Scientists do not talk very much to literary men and vice versa. Neither group seems to<br>know, nor want to know, very much about the other.<br>Snow argues that the scientific people and the literary people are moving further and<br>further apart. Few scientists or engineers read literature; very few writers or intellectuals<br>know or care anything about science.<br>This, Snow thinks, is a major problem in the world today. Literary culture seems to be<br>anti-science and anti-technology. This affects Western reluctance to train more scientists<br>and engineers.<br>The standard of living in the West, and throughout the world, depends on having<br>scientists and engineers. Nonetheless, relatively little effort is given to encouraging and<br>developing these areas of education.<br>Westerners, who are part of the literary culture, do not encourage or understand the<br>scientific revolution. As a result, they are insensitive to the desire of Third World peoples<br>to improve their lives through technology.<br>Snow talks about how the standard of living in England has improved since 1800. Snow's<br>grandfather did not go far in school, but did learn to read and write. Living in 1900, he<br>realized that he was better off than his grandfather who lived in the early 1800s. Snow's<br>great-great-grandfather was a farm labourer who didn't know how to read or write. Snow<br>feels that a similar transformation could happen even in very poor countries. It could<br>happen in a short time if the West supplied capital and engineers.<br>Snow believes that it is the industrial revolution that has transformed the West. This is<br>what has allowed the farm labourers to go to school and to learn employable skills. In<br>1800, only a small proportion of society could expect to live well. Now nearly everyone<br>has access to education and training. The same industrial revolution can happen in Third<br>World countries. It is the only way to improve the lot of the poor.<br>Snow agrees that most scientists and engineers do not read novels or cultivate the arts.<br>However, he doesn't consider this to be as dangerous as when literary people ignore<br>science and technology. Science and technology are too important to our standard of<br>living to be ignored; our education systems have to be changed to reflect our need of<br>them.<br>Snow's article was quite controversial. Not everyone agreed with him that science and<br>technology are being ignored by our educational system. But Snow certainly has a point<br>when he says that scientific people and literary people view the world differently. These<br>two different mindsets often lead to conflict in the workplace. Snow may be right that it is<br>too easy for literary-minded students to ignore science, and scientifically minded<br>students to ignore literature.<br>",

When both sides failed to win a clear victory, and the<br>costs of the war kept growing, the two countries decided that peace was the best policy.<br>On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain. The United States had<br>proclaimed their independence from Britain in 1776--36 years earlier. There were still bad<br>feelings between the two countries. Great Britain was not treating the United States as an<br>equal independent country. British ships were stopping American ships from trading with<br>Europe. British sailors went aboard American ships looking for deserters from the British<br>Navy. If an American sailor could not prove that he was an American, he was taken to<br>work for the British.<br>At the same time, the population of the United States was expanding. Americans wanted<br>to move west into lands held by various American Indian tribes. Some Americans felt that<br>Britain was encouraging the Indians to fight them and was supplying guns to the Indians.<br>In 1812, Canada was made up of a small number of British colonies just north of the<br>American border. Americans felt that it would be easy to take over Canada; then<br>Canadian land would provide homes for their growing population. Since Americans<br>outnumbered Canadians ten to one, the U.S. government thought that no one in Canada<br>would dare to oppose them. Moreover, Britain was fighting a terrible war in Europe<br>against Napoleon, the Emperor of France, and could not spare any troops to help defend<br>Canada.<br>But, in 1812, Canada had one advantage over the U.S.A.--good leadership. British<br>General Isaac Brock had served in Canada for ten years. He knew how to inspire both his<br>own soldiers and the ordinary people of Canada to fight for their country. He was a bold<br>and energetic leader who moved quickly to attack American positions before they could<br>attack him.<br>Brock found a valuable ally in the American Indian Chief Tecumseh. Tecumseh had been<br>trying to unite the scattered groups of Indians to fight together against American<br>expansion. He convinced the Indians that their best chance for success was to join the<br>British and Canadians against the Americans. Although both Brock and Tecumseh were<br>killed in battles, their example continued to inspire the defenders of Canada to fight<br>against the American invasions. Before the end of 1814, all American forces had been<br>driven out of Canada.<br>By 1814, Britain had defeated the French Emperor Napoleon. Now it was the turn of the<br>United States to be invaded. A large British force attacked the heart of the United States,<br>and burned the government buildings at Washington. Another British force attacked the<br>U.S.A. near the mouth of the Mississippi River, but it was defeated at the Battle of New<br>Orleans.<br>Both sides were tired of fighting by this time, and a peace treaty was signed on<br>December 24, 1814. This agreement restored everything to the way it had been when the<br>war began. Although this really meant that no one had won the war, both sides claimed<br>victory. The Americans felt that they had gained full recognition of their independence.<br>Britain would no longer board their ships, or encourage the Indians to fight them.<br>Canadians felt that they had shown Americans that they wanted to develop their own<br>country in their own way, separate from the United States. But the biggest result of the<br>war was the decision by both countries never to fight each other again.<br>",

        Title: "North American Death and Burial",
        Content:
          "Most people in North American die either in hospital or at home. When someone dies,<br>arrangements are made with a funeral home to get the body and prepare it for burial.<br>Funeral homes are private businesses. They usually handle most or all aspects of a<br>funeral, except for providing the burial plot. That usually has to be purchased separately.<br>Funeral homes may operate in many kinds of buildings. Old roomy private homes and<br>new modern one-level buildings are common types. When the funeral director receives<br>the body, his staff embalms it so it will not decay quickly and will look lifelike at the<br>funeral service. For one or two days before the burial, friends, relatives and<br>acquaintances are invited to visit the funeral home and pay their respects to the dead<br>person. The deceased person is usually dressed in their best clothes, and lying on their<br>back in a coffin. A coffin is a large wooden or metal chest designed to hold the body.<br>Members of the dead person's immediate family usually act as hosts for the funeral home<br>visitation. They greet the mourners and talk to them about the deceased. Usually, there<br>are happy photographs of the dead person near the coffin. Gifts of flowers also surround<br>the coffin. Usually the mourners are asked to sign a guest book.<br>The funeral service may take place at a church, if the deceased person wanted that.<br>Frequently, however, the service is held at a chapel at the funeral home. Attending a<br>funeral is considered a sign of respect, and people will often travel a long distance to<br>attend. Usually friends and relatives will take a day off work for the occasion. Notices are<br>put in the newspaper for several days before, so that people will know when to come.<br>A minister or priest usually conducts the funeral service. There will be hymns, prayers,<br>and perhaps a sermon, like a regular church service. Sometimes, the minister will speak<br>at length about the dead person. Sometimes, a member of the family does this.<br>Opportunity is allowed for other people to talk about their memories of the dead person.<br>At the end of the service, the coffin is wheeled out to a waiting car, called a hearse, which<br>drives the dead person to the burial place. The mourners go to their cars and follow the<br>hearse to the cemetery.<br>At the cemetery, a hole has already been dug to receive the coffin. Usually there is a<br>short ceremony at the grave. Sometimes, flowers are put on top of the coffin as it is<br>lowered into the grave. A handful of soil is tossed on the coffin, indicating burial. Usually<br>the mourners leave before the cemetery workers cover the coffin with earth. Then the<br>mourners may all go back to a church hall or restaurant for a meal.<br>A funeral can be quite costly. Even an inexpensive coffin can be several thousand dollars.<br>Sometimes, the deceased will be placed in an expensive rental coffin for the visitation<br>and funeral, but buried in a less expensive coffin. Even so, a full funeral rarely costs less<br>than $5,000, and usually quite a lot more. And this does not include the price of the burial<br>plot or the stone grave marker. Sometimes poor people are buried at government<br>expense.<br>It is traditional in North American to bury the whole body in the ground. However,<br>cremation is becoming more popular. The advantage of cremation is that it is less<br>expensive, uses less land, and it appeals to people who don't want an elaborate funeral.<br>Some people may wonder why so much attention is paid to a dead person. But funerals<br>are really for the living. They are a way of saying goodbye to the dead person and<br>receiving mutual support and encouragement from friends and family. Some funeral<br>homes help to organize grief counselling or support groups to grieving family members.<br>Usually the funeral service is performed in the Christian tradition and refers to the hope<br>of resurrection or rebirth from the dead that Christians believe in. It is now becoming<br>common for people to plan their own funeral service before they die. And usually<br>attempts are made to make the service appropriate to the person who died. This makes it<br>more satisfying and memorable for the family and friends.<br>",

        Title: "Anastasia and the Russian Revoluion",
        Content:
          "The twentieth century brought many changes to traditional cultures around the world.<br>Some of the most radical changes occurred in the Russian Empire, which had one of the<br>oldest monarchies in Europe. In 1917-18 the rule of the Tsars was replaced by the world's<br>first communist government led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. No one was more affected by<br>these changes than Anastasia, the Tsar's youngest daughter.<br>Between 1895 and 1901, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra, became the parents of<br>four beautiful and healthy daughters - Olga, Tatiana, Marie and Anastasia. However, since<br>a girl could not inherit the throne of Russia, it was important for Alexandra to give birth<br>to a son. Finally, in 1904, the Tsar and Tsarina had a son, Aleksei.<br>This event, which should have made the whole family very happy, proved to be a source<br>of great sorrow. Aleksei was soon found to have an incurable disease. This disease,<br>hemophilia, meant that Aleksei regularly suffered from uncontrollable internal and<br>external bleeding which left him very weak. This caused anxiety for all the family,<br>especially his mother and father.<br>The Tsar and Tsarina loved their children. The girls, who didn't have to worry about<br>becoming rulers, led a fairly carefree existence. Anastasia and her sisters lived in a<br>palace with hundreds of servants. They attended many society parties with their parents.<br>The most elaborate parties were the grand balls, where everyone dressed in their finest<br>clothes and danced all through the night.<br>The absolute rule of the Tsar was not popular with everybody. The majority of the<br>population was poor peasant farmers who could barely keep themselves and their<br>families alive. If they moved into the city to get jobs in the factories, they had to work<br>long hours for very low wages, and live in slum conditions. Popular opposition forced<br>the Tsar in 1905 to give up some of his power to an elected parliament.<br>None of the girls married. They all lived a happy life together. They moved from palace to<br>palace, attended by their private tutors, visiting the beach, and sailing on the royal yacht.<br>Anastasia was the clown of the family. She didn't like schoolwork, but she enjoyed<br>painting and photography. Many of her photos of the royal family in happy times survive.<br>Soon the Tsar's problems worsened. The Empress Alexandra worried about her son and<br>became ill. War with Germany broke out in 1914, and the Russians suffered many defeats<br>and losses. In March 1917, there was popular revolution, and the Tsar was deposed.<br>From that time on, the royal family was prisoners. At first, they were treated kindly, but in<br>November, the Bolsheviks or communists gained control of the revolution. Lenin and his<br>followers hated the Tsar.<br>The royal family had been living in Tobolsk in Siberia. Because of fears that they might<br>escape, they were brought back to Ekaterinburg in the Ural region. Here, after midnight<br>on June 19, 1918, the entire royal family was shot by the Bolsheviks.<br>To some, this news was too dreadful to be believed. The thought that the Tsar's lively and<br>beautiful daughters had been killed was too hard to bear. Within a couple of years, a<br>woman who went by the name of Anna Anderson appeared in western Europe. She<br>claimed to be Anastasia. Some believed her story and some did not.<br>With the fall of the Soviet Union, it was possible to investigate the murder of the royal<br>family. It was also possible to prove that Anna Anderson was not the real Anastasia. After<br>a long search, the bodies of Anastasia and Aleksei were found. They had died with the<br>rest of the family. A great mystery was finally solved.<br>",

        Title: "Australian Origins",
        Content:
          "In many countries, leading families proudly trace their ancestors back to some<br>significant group of people. In the U..S.A., prominent individuals may boast that their<br>family came over on the Mayflower in 1620.<br>In England, ladies and gentlemen are happy to announce that their ancestors came to<br>Britain with William the Conqueror in 1066. In Australia, however, many leading families<br>are reluctant to talk about their origins. In fact, many years ago, one Australian city<br>burned its early records, so that no one would know who their ancestors were. The<br>reason for this is that Australia began its history as a British penal colony.<br>In eighteenth century England, there was a large gap between the rich and the poor. To<br>make matters worse, many farmers had been forced off their land by powerful<br>landowners. These homeless people wandered to the cities, where employment was<br>often hard to find. Frequent wars gave temporary employment to young men as soldiers<br>and sailors, but when the war was over, they were no better off than before.<br>As a result, theft was extremely common. To protect themselves, the upper classes made<br>theft punishable by hanging. The problem with this was that juries were often reluctant to<br>hang someone for stealing something small, and might declare the person @x@not guilty.@x@<br>For example, if a man or woman stole a loaf of bread to feed their children, the jury might<br>just let them go. To prevent this, the courts came up with a new category of punishment--<br>exile or @x@transportation.@x@ If the judge or jury was reluctant to sentence the accused to<br>death, they would ship them far away from England across the seas. However, if the<br>person was found back in England again, he or she would be hanged.<br>At first, England sent its convicts to America's Thirteen Colonies. However, when the<br>United States declared its independence in 1776, this was no longer possible. England<br>considered sending criminals to West Africa, but the land and climate were considered<br>unsuitable. So finally Great Britain decided to use the huge, almost uninhabited, country<br>of Australia. At this time, not a single European was living anywhere on the continent.<br>In the fall of 1786, a fleet of English ships began to take convicts on board. This process<br>continued till the sailing date of May 13, 1787. Many British jails had been cleared of both<br>male and female prisoners.<br>Since the convicts were technically under a sentence of death, there was little concern<br>for making them comfortable. At first, the convicts were chained below decks, but later<br>some were released when well out to sea. One man had been sentenced for the theft of a<br>winter coat; another for stealing cucumbers from a garden; a third for carrying off a<br>sheep. Among the women, one was guilty of stealing a large cheese; another of taking<br>several yards of cloth.<br>These ships known as @x@The First Fleet@x@ carried 1,442 convicts, sailors, marines and<br>officers. The fleet finally arrived at Botany Bay on January 10, 1788. Later that month,<br>they moved down to Sydney Harbour. No preparations whatsoever had been made. The<br>forests came right up to the shore. Soon, the fleet members were cutting down trees and<br>trying to put up tents. It was June 1790 before further supplies arrived from England.<br>Meanwhile, many convicts suffered from sickness, aggravated by lack of good food.<br>In conclusion, Australians need not be ashamed of their origins. In time, great things<br>were achieved, in spite of the almost complete lack of help from the English government.<br>Many ex- convicts became respectable settlers who began prosperous farms and<br>businesses. The members of the First Fleet, whether convicts or not, deserve to be<br>honoured as the founders of Australia.<br>",

        Content:
          "Many people visit Europe and see the old castles left from the days of knighthood. Very<br>few return home with plans to build their own castle. Toronto businessman Henry Pellatt<br>actually built such a castle - Casa Loma.<br>Pellatt was born in Kingston, Ontario in 1859, but the family soon moved to Toronto. His<br>father opened Toronto's first stock broking firm in 1866. Pellatt Sr. became part of<br>Toronto's financial elite. And Henry Pellatt eventually joined his father in business.<br>The young Pellatt was especially attracted by the military and the British armed forces.<br>When Henry was 18, he joined the Queen's Own Rifles, a militia unit. He was soon one of<br>the soldiers sent to suppress a railway strike. At 21, he was made an officer, and<br>gradually moved up through the ranks, eventually becoming brigadier general.<br>Meanwhile, Henry was learning the stock broking business. He soon showed<br>considerable ability at forming new companies. Electricity was a recent invention, and<br>Pellatt hoped to be among the foremost developers. In 1883, he founded the Toronto<br>Electric Light Company, and later was an owner of the Toronto Electric Railway. He also<br>made money as a land speculator in the Canadian West. Unlike many businessmen of the<br>time, however, Pellatt believed in community service. He sponsored many charitable<br>organizations and supported various good causes.<br>In spite of his business dealings, Pellatt found time to tour England and Europe regularly.<br>He brought back ideas for a @x@castle on the hill.@x@ Pellatt's castle, however, would not be a<br>damp, drafty castle of the Middle Ages. It would have all the latest technology.<br>Construction of @x@Casa Loma@x@ began in 1910 and was completed in 1914. Outwardly, it<br>looked like a mediaeval castle, but inside it was comfortable and luxurious. There were<br>98 rooms, three bowling alleys, 30 bathrooms, 25 fireplaces and 5,000 electric lights. It<br>had an electric elevator and an indoor swimming pool. There was a library of 100,000<br>books, a temperature-controlled wine cellar, a shooting gallery, and a large art collection.<br>Pellatt ordered only the most expensive materials and employed the best craftsmen. The<br>cost of all this was $3.5 million, a huge sum in those days.<br>Pellatt and his wife liked to entertain. They often opened up Casa Loma for special events.<br>Sometimes, he would invite all 1,000 men from the Queen's Own Rifles over for the<br>weekend. The Pellatts also held parties for the staff.<br>Pellatt had hoped that Casa Loma would be the center of an extensive subdivision. He<br>hoped that wealthy people would build grand homes nearby, and so he had bought up<br>land near his castle. Unfortunately for Pellatt, most of the people coming to Toronto were<br>poor immigrants who couldn't afford large houses. Pellatt was unable to sell his land<br>holdings, and his income declined. In 1924, Pellatt turned Casa Loma over to the City of<br>Toronto because he could not pay his property tax.<br>All the contents of Casa Loma went on auction soon after. His $1.5 million collection of<br>art and artifacts sold for only $250,000. Now Casa Loma is a leading Toronto tourist<br>attraction. @x@The castle in the middle of the city@x@ has 400,000 visitors each year. It is the<br>closest thing in North America to a real European castle.<br>",

        Title: "Charlie Brown",
        Content:
          "On October 2, 1950, a new comic strip appeared in American newspapers. The @x@hero@x@ of<br>the strip was a round-headed kid named Charlie Brown. In the very first cartoon, two<br>young schoolmates watch Charlie Brown walking by, and one comments, @x@Well! Here<br>comes ol' Charlie Brown.Yes, Sir! Good ol' Charlie Brown. How I hate him!@x@<br>This comic strip was to become one of the most popular in history. Its creator, Charles M.<br>Schultz, drew the strip for 50 years until his death. But reruns of @x@Peanuts@x@ still appear<br>regularly in the newspaper. What are some of the characteristics of Charlie Brown and<br>his friends that have made the cartoon popular?<br>Charlie Brown is an unlikely hero. Other kids don't like being around him because the<br>things he does never seem to work out properly. Kids want to be with someone who is<br>good-looking, popular and successful, so that they can feel a part of his success. Charlie<br>Brown is always worrying, hardly ever up-beat, afraid of failure, and always making<br>mistakes. His kite gets snagged in a tree, he needs counseling from Lucy, his dog<br>Snoopy is more popular than he is, and the little red-haired girl never notices him. In<br>short, Charlie Brown is a @x@loser.@x@<br>Charlie Brown illustrates all the insecurities that kids have. Many of these anxieties carry<br>over into adult life. Sometimes, they reflect problems in the life of the comic strip's<br>creator, Charles M. Schulz. Schulz suffered from depression much of his life and had a<br>difficult time in school. He was not very popular with his classmates. Humour and<br>laughter are often a way of dealing with problems. And in the @x@Peanuts@x@ strip, the world<br>can laugh at all the silly little things that people do.<br>Because of its honest way of dealing with problems, Charlie Brown and his friends are<br>more interesting than the average comic strip characters. The characters represent adult<br>personality types. Charlie Brown is @x@wishy-washy,@x@ and is afraid to do things for fear of<br>failure. Lucy is a pushy overbearing female, who thinks she knows it all. Linus, her<br>younger brother, is intellectual but insecure. He still clings to his baby blanket for<br>security. Schroeder is preoccupied with Beethoven's music to the exclusion of<br>everything else.<br>Sally, Charlie Brown's younger sister, combines both a romantic attachment to Linus and<br>a desire for material things. Peppermint Patty is a tomboy who loves baseball, but<br>nonetheless has a romantic crush on Charlie Brown. Snoopy, the dog, represents a cool<br>detached inventive individual who also relies on basic creature comforts.<br>These characters add up to a @x@human comedy.@x@ In the comic strip, we can see ourselves<br>and the people around us: making mistakes, getting second chances, but tending to do<br>the same things over again.<br>Behind the humour of @x@Peanuts@x@ there is a serious message. Words can hurt.<br>Relationships are important. Truth is difficult to find. Criticism is too common. Greed can<br>easily overpower us. These messages are both timeless and timely.<br>@x@Peanuts@x@ has also been turned into television specials and several movies. Snoopy<br>stuffed toys are popular all over the world. A huge industry has grown from a simple<br>comic strip. Perhaps this means that, while we all secretly want to be @x@winners,@x@ we<br>really identify more closely with the Charlie Browns of this world!<br>",

His endurance was so much admired that runners ever<br>since have attempted to run similar long @x@Marathon@x@ distances.<br>In the twentieth century, however, long distance swimming has also attracted attention<br>and admiration. To swim the English Channel or Juan de Fuca Strait between Vancouver<br>Island and the mainland have become challenges for both male and female swimmers.<br>In September 1954, some Canadian businessman from Toronto offered veteran<br>Californian champion Florence Chadwick $10,000 if she could swim Lake Ontario. They<br>felt sure that such a feat would attract large crowds. Chadwick had swum the English<br>Channel in both directions. However, no one - neither man nor woman - had crossed<br>Lake Ontario. It was a 32-mile swim through cold water and difficult currents. Two other<br>women also decided to take up the challenge. One, Winnie Roach Leuszler, had also<br>swum the English Channel. The other was a 16 year old girl named Marilyn Bell.<br>The swimmers traveled to the mouth of the Niagara River on the south side of Lake<br>Ontario. They would swim from Youngstown, in the U.S.A., and back to Toronto. Bad<br>weather delayed the swim for several days. During the night of September 8th the<br>weather cleared, and the swimmers entered the water before midnight. Guided by her<br>coach's flashlight, Marilyn swam through the dark water and soon passed Chadwick,<br>who was lifted from the water after swimming 12 miles. Leuszler made it further, but she<br>too eventually had to give up.<br>Marilyn not only had to overcome her fears of the dark, but she was attacked during the<br>night by blood-sucking lamprey eels. She was able to knock these off with her fist. As<br>dawn approached, the winds and waves increased, and Marilyn's weariness mounted.<br>Her coach, Gus Ryder, passed her some corn syrup on a stick, and later gave her<br>liniment for her tired legs. He wrote messages on a blackboard to encourage her to keep<br>going. Sometimes, he tricked her into thinking that she was nearer to the shore than she<br>was.<br>Marilyn fell asleep in the water twice and had to be awakened. The second time, a friend<br>of hers jumped into the water beside her, and swam with her for a distance.<br>Because Marilyn's strength was declining, she was being pushed off course by the<br>currents. Although the direct route was 32 miles, Marilyn swam a total of 45 miles. The<br>last few miles were extremely difficult. Marilyn's family and the lifeguards felt that she<br>should be taken out of the water. But her coach threatened to quit as her coach if the<br>swimmer gave up.<br>It was getting dark again, and the swimmer was barely conscious as she approached the<br>shore. Thousands of people lined the shore hoping to touch her or get a picture of her.<br>Marilyn's supporters had to push the crowds back so they wouldn't stop her from<br>touching the shore. Finally, after 21 hours in the water, Marilyn reached land. The<br>exhausted girl was rushed to an ambulance. She had lost about 20 pounds of her 120<br>pounds weight in the crossing. Finally she was able to sleep.<br>Huge crowds came out to see her the next day, and two days later there was a parade in<br>her honour through the streets of Toronto. Everyone admired the courage and endurance<br>of the 16 year-old girl, who became the first person to swim across Lake Ontario.<br>",

        Content:
          "Before the widespread use of photography, there was a large market for artistic<br>depictions of scenes and events. A process for making prints called lithography became<br>popular in North America during the early nineteenth century. One young artist who<br>mastered this technique was Nathaniel Currier (1813-1888). Currier opened his own shop<br>in 1834. Currier's success came when he issued prints of newsworthy events. His @x@Ruins<br>of the Merchant's Exchange@x@ followed a great fire in New York, December 1834. One of<br>Currier's prints of a disastrous fire on a steamboat was published in the New York Sun in<br>1840.<br>There was also a large market for decorative prints. People who couldn't afford oil<br>paintings would buy colour prints to put on their walls. Some of these prints were copies<br>of paintings. Sometimes, Currier mentioned his source and sometimes not.<br>In 1852, James Merritt Ives (1824-1895) joined Currier's firm. In 1857, he became Currier's<br>partner. After that, the firm was known as Currier and Ives.<br>Altogether the firm produced about 7,000 different subjects. Small prints sold for about<br>25 cents, and large colour prints for about three dollars. Travelling salesmen went from<br>house to house selling them. Currier and Ives sometimes hired the original painters to<br>make the print. More often, someone from his or her own studio either composed an<br>original subject or copied an existing painting or drawing.<br>Contemporary news remained popular. Currier and Ives prints included @x@The First<br>Appearance of Jenny Lind in America@x@ (1850), @x@The Fall of Richmond, Virginia@x@ (1865),<br>and @x@The Great Fire at Chicago@x@ (1871). A common subject was a patriotic scene from<br>American history. Interesting occupations such as whaling, bird hunting, trapping, fur<br>trading and deep-sea fishing were portrayed. Pioneer and Indian topics were in demand.<br>However, the most popular of all scenes were winter and holiday prints of ordinary<br>people enjoying life. Farm scenes, buggy rides, sleigh rides, market scenes, blacksmith's<br>shops, and town scenes sold well. Favourite prints included @x@American Forest Scene:<br>Maple Sugaring@x@ (1860), @x@Home to Thanksgiving@x@ (1863), @x@Winter in the Country@x@ (1862),<br>@x@Life in the Country: The Morning Ride@x@ (1859) and @x@American Winter Sports@x@ (1856).<br>These scenes are still popular. Even today you can buy Christmas cards with Currier and<br>Ives winter scenes.<br>This collection of prints gives a remarkable picture of America between 1834 and 1907.<br>Although the prints are sometimes more romantic than reality, they give a lot of<br>information about everyday life. They depict styles of clothing, trains and boats,<br>buildings and bridges and popular activities. They also tell us what sorts of scenes<br>people at that time liked, and what their artistic tastes were.<br>Eventually, advances in photography made this kind of printmaking obsolete. In 1906, the<br>firm of Currier and Ives closed its doors. For a while, these prints were not considered<br>very valuable. Nowadays, however, there are many collectors, and Currier and Ives prints<br>once again can be found decorating North American homes.<br>",

        Content:
          "The steep mountains of southeastern California dip suddenly into a deep valley. Rain is<br>kept out of the valley by the high mountains, which form its western slopes. Although<br>mountains surround the valley, Death Valley itself is very low. In fact, its lowest point is<br>282 feet below sea level, the lowest point of land in North or South America.<br>Death Valley is about 140 miles long, but only a few miles wide. It got its name in 1849<br>during the California Gold Rush. Gold seekers attempted to cross Death Valley on the<br>way to California's gold fields, and some died of thirst there. There is hardly any water in<br>the Valley. The average rainfall is only a couple of inches a year. It is also one of the<br>hottest places in North America in the summer. Temperatures of 134튔 have been<br>recorded.<br>As a result of this heat and dryness, Death Valley is a desert. These conditions give rise<br>to the Valley's most important products - mineral salts and salt deposits. One of these<br>products is borax, which has many industrial uses. Borax was removed from the desert<br>using 20 mule teams hitched in a long string. Later, a railway was built to help carry out<br>these minerals.<br>In spite of its desert conditions, Death Valley has considerable animal and plant life. Of<br>course, its animals and plants are those typical in desert conditions. Only on the salt<br>flats do plants refuse to grow. With even a small rainfall in the spring, the desert will<br>come alive with wild flowers.<br>Very few places in the world have such a contrast in heights and depths. The mountains<br>near the Valley are among the highest in Continental U.S.A., while the Valley itself is the<br>lowest elevation. Mount Whitney at 14,495 feet is less than 100 miles from Death Valley.<br>The climate in the Valley from October to May is generally pleasant. Since Death Valley is<br>now a national park, many tourists visit during this season. Now roads and hotels<br>provide comfortable access.<br>Death Valley is located close to the Nevada border. Its desert conditions are common<br>throughout the area of the American west just east of coastal mountains. In most cases,<br>heavy rain falls along the coast, but very little in the interior. Because there is no farming<br>and water is hard to obtain, Death Valley and similar desert areas have very few<br>permanent residents.<br>",

        Content:
          "Some people find their vocation early in life; others do not discover their life's work until<br>they are older. Norman Bethune tried many things before he fully realized his true work.<br>Bethune was born in Gravenhurst, Ontario in 1890. He was the son of a Presbyterian<br>clergyman. The family moved frequently, and many of the places they lived were close to<br>lakes, rivers and woods.<br>As a young man, Norman loved the outdoors. He became a good swimmer and skater. He<br>also showed that he had a strong independent streak. He hated rules, but also had a<br>strong sense of justice.<br>The young man studied science at the University of Toronto from 1909-1911. After that,<br>he worked for Frontier College. This was a volunteer organization where instructors did<br>the same jobs as the local workers during the day, and taught them English in the<br>evening. He then returned to Toronto to study medicine.<br>Early in World War I, he joined the Army Medical Corps. He reached France in February<br>1915, but was wounded in April and eventually returned to Canada. He went back to the<br>war in 1917. At the end of the war, he continued to study medicine in London, England.<br>While he was in England, he married a Scottish woman, Frances Campbell Penney.<br>Although Bethune loved her very much, their marriage ended in divorce in 1927. The<br>couple moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1924 where Bethune opened a medical practice. In<br>the middle of his growing success, he contracted tuberculosis. This was a low point in<br>Bethune's life. Thinking that he was going to die, he considered suicide. One day,<br>however, he read of a new treatment for tuberculosis and insisted that his doctors<br>perform the operation on him. As a result, Bethune recovered. The year was 1927.<br>For some years after, Bethune devoted himself to the treatment of tuberculosis patients.<br>However, he began to notice a pattern. Rich patients who could afford proper medical<br>care usually recovered. Poor patients usually died. Bethune became a supporter of<br>government-funded medicinal care.<br>Bethune admired the government-funded health system in communist Russia. He was<br>angry when Canada would not support his idea about Medicare. Bethune wanted to<br>change the world, and communism seemed like the most promising method.<br>In 1936, Bethune went to Spain to help the Republicans fight the Fascists. He was<br>appalled to see the Fascists' allies, Germany and Italy, dropping bombs on women and<br>children. He developed a hated for Fascism. He also decided that doctors should go to<br>the front, rather than wait for the wounded to be brought to them. In Spain, he developed<br>a blood transfusion service, which saved many lives.<br>Returning to North America, Bethune heard about the Japanese attack on China in 1937.<br>Early in 1938, he sailed for China. Bethune had joined the Communist Party. Now he went<br>to join the army of Mao Tse-sung in Northern China. Mao's army was suffering badly from<br>Japanese attacks. They had hardly any doctors or medical supplies.<br>Difficulties only made Bethune work harder. He soon organized a hospital, trained<br>medical workers, and wrote textbooks. He insisted on operating right at the front to give<br>the wounded a better chance of survival. He went for days without sleep and gave his<br>own blood to help the wounded. In November 1939, he died from blood poisoning. But<br>his work lived on.<br>In 1973, the Canadian government bought his house that he was born in and turned it<br>into a museum.<br>",

        Content:
          "In the story @x@A Christmas Carol,@x@ Scrooge is an English businessman who thinks about<br>nothing but money. He has no friends, and spends no time with his family. He lives alone,<br>eats alone, and works alone, except for his underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit. Scrooge never<br>spends his money, but hoards it all, and prides himself on his frugality.<br>Scrooge hates Christmas. It is all nonsense to him. People spend money on food, and<br>gifts, and parties. Often they can't afford what they spend. Worse than that, they take a<br>whole day off work and so lose a chance to make more money. Scrooge is angry that he<br>has to give his clerk the day off with pay. He feels that he is being robbed.<br>Christmas is also a time when people are asked to give money to help the poor. Scrooge<br>is angry when two men come to his door asking for donations. Scrooge argues that he<br>pays taxes, which support prisons and workhouses. It is not his business to worry about<br>the problems of other people. Scrooge represents businessmen who see the @x@bottom<br>line@x@ as all that matters.<br>Scrooge's partner Marley had died seven years earlier. He was like Scrooge in all<br>respects. That evening, which is Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost.<br>Marley drags steel chains round about him, which contain keys, cash-boxes, ledgers,<br>purses and deeds. These are the things that Marley cared about when he was alive.<br>Marley is condemned in death to wander the world and tells Scrooge that the same fate is<br>likely to happen to him. However, three spirits will visit Scrooge, and if Scrooge listens to<br>them, he may escape his fate.<br>The first spirit comes and takes Scrooge back to the early scenes of his own life. He sees<br>himself being left behind at school while the other boys went home for the holidays.<br>Then his little sister arrives to tell him he could go home too. Another scene was of a<br>cheerful Christmas party, when Scrooge was a young man. A third scene showed him<br>with the girl he was planning to marry. She left him because he no longer cared about<br>anything but money.<br>The second spirit shows Scrooge what people are doing that very Christmas. He shows<br>Scrooge the preparations that people, even poor people, are making to celebrate<br>Christmas. They visit Bob Cratchit's tiny home. There they see the family cooking their<br>little Christmas dinner. Bob's son, Tiny Tim, has been weakened by disease, and has to<br>use a crutch to walk. The family is delighted with its meal, small as it is. They see other<br>scenes of poor people--miners and sailors --celebrating Christmas. Finally, they visit<br>Scrooge's nephew, and view his Christmas party and its games.<br>The third spirit was the spirit of Christmas Yet to Come - the Future. This spirit does not<br>talk but points to scenes connected with Scrooge. They overhear some businessmen<br>joking about someone who has recently died, but no one is going to the funeral. Scrooge<br>sees that he no longer occupies his usual place of business. The spirit then shows him<br>two women who have stolen the bedclothes, curtains, and clothes of the dead man and<br>taken them to a pawnbroker. The spirit takes Scrooge to the room where the dead man<br>died. The only people who are happy about the death are a young couple who owed him<br>money. The spirit then shows Scrooge the Cratchit's house, where they are mourning the<br>death of Tiny Tim. Finally, the spirit takes him to a churchyard, where they stand among<br>the graves. Then the spirit points to the name of the dead man on the tombstone--<br>@x@Ebenezer Scrooge.@x@ Scrooge is going to die, and no one will care.<br>Scrooge finds himself in his own bed on Christmas morning. He is resolved now to avoid<br>the fate that the spirits had shown him. He is delighted that he is getting a second<br>chance. Scrooge decides to surprise all his acquaintances, and he begins by buying a<br>huge goose and sending it to the Cratchits. On his walk, he meets the two men collecting<br>for the poor, and offers them a large sum of money. He goes on to join his nephew at his<br>Christmas party. The next day when Bob Cratchit comes into work, Scrooge gives him a<br>raise in his salary. He also takes care of Tiny Tim, so that Tim's health is recovered.<br>Charles Dickens' story was written at a time when governments did very little to help the<br>poor. Wages were very low, and many businessmen were unwilling to look after their<br>workers properly. Dickens points out that people like Scrooge not only make other<br>people unhappy, but also are usually unhappy themselves. It is possible to be a very rich<br>businessman, and a poor human being at the same time.<br>",

        Content:
          "@x@Etiquette@x@ is a French word. The original meaning was @x@little tickets.@x@ These tickets were<br>given to people who were attending a public ceremony. Printed on the ticket were<br>instructions about how to behave on this occasion. So etiquette came to mean the way to<br>behave on public occasions.<br>Etiquette today includes how to introduce people; how to eat properly; how to dress for<br>different occasions; how to speak to different people; and what to do on special<br>occasions. Almost every part of social life can have its particular etiquette.<br>Sometimes, etiquette changes or seems to change. There was much behaviour attached<br>to courtship, such as a man holding the door open for a woman. Nowadays, some people<br>find this outdated. But politeness is always a good idea. It is nice to hold the door open<br>for the next person, whoever they are.<br>In fact, it sometimes seems like contemporary life encourages bad manners. Etiquette is<br>no longer taught to young people. Moreover, in a youth culture, young people take their<br>examples from other young people. As a result, good manners aren't considered<br>important.<br>The point of etiquette is to help people to get along with each other. If people behave in<br>an accepted manner, there is less chance of misunderstanding. Moreover, it is important<br>for people to think about treating other people well. If everyone does what they feel like<br>doing, it doesn't seem like they respect other people. Etiquette can help things to go a lot<br>smoother.<br>Manners vary from culture to culture, but the intention is the same: to treat people with<br>consideration. This is a way to reduce conflict.<br>Sometimes, we can understand where these customs come from. Originally, shaking<br>hands with your right hand probably meant that you weren't carrying a weapon. Taking<br>off your hat may originally have been taking off your helmet. This meant that you weren't<br>going to fight.<br>Nowadays, there are new areas of social life. For example, a lot of conversation now<br>takes place on the telephone. Perhaps because there is no traditional telephone etiquette,<br>some people feel free to be rude. Try to treat the person on the phone just the way you<br>would treat them if you were actually talking to them. Most people feel it is rude to<br>interrupt a conversation. But many people seem to think that it is okay to interrupt<br>someone talking on the phone. Children especially need to be taught not to interrupt.<br>The Internet also needs its own etiquette or @x@netiquette.@x@ Because you cannot see whom<br>you are talking to, and they may be thousands of miles away, it is easy to misunderstand.<br>Also people cannot hear the tone of your voice over the Internet. For this reason, some<br>people use @x@smilies@x@ - little faces - to show how they are feeling. If they make a joke they<br>can use a smiling face, or print after their remark. This tips off the recipient that their<br>remark is not to be taken seriously.<br>Using simple words like @x@please@x@ and @x@thank you@x@ can make everyday life a lot smoother<br>and happier. Like a lot of other things, we do not realize the importance of etiquette until<br>it starts to disappear.<br>",

Most new<br>casinos include a variety of slot machines, table games, such as blackjack, and roulette<br>wheels.<br>Opponents of gambling point to problems associated with it.

Stress is put on families when one member gambles, and<br>the grocery and rent money are spent.<br>On the other hand, many people view gambling as an exciting form of entertainment.<br>They look forward to the opportunity to play the lottery or go to the casino. Often they<br>feel that they are getting good value, in terms of entertainment, for what they spend.<br>The truth is probably that some people can control the urge to gamble, while some<br>cannot. People who find gambling really exciting feel that they have to go back for that<br>@x@high,@x@ even if it means spending all their money. Many people doubt that governments<br>should promote gambling, since it is certain to produce addicts.<br>There has also been some question whether gambling is good for the local economy. If a<br>casino is built in an area of high unemployment, will local people really benefit? The<br>answer seems to be both yes and no. People may benefit if the gamblers come in large<br>numbers from outside the area and spend their money there. That is, if the casino is a<br>notable tourist attraction. On the other hand, if not many people come from outside the<br>area, there are few benefits. In this case, most of the gamblers are local people who are<br>spending the little money they have.<br>Gambling is especially attractive to older and retired people. Since older people don't<br>have much chance of making a lot of new money, the thought of winning the jackpot is<br>very attractive to them. Casinos regularly run buses from retirement homes so that<br>seniors can come and gamble. Some would see this as taking advantage of lonely people.<br>There are stories in the newspaper about couples leaving their children locked in the car<br>for six or eight hours while they gamble. One man hoped to improve his finances by<br>gambling, but he lost heavily. His wife found out and went gambling herself, hoping to<br>win some of the money back. Before long, they had to sell their house to pay their<br>gambling debts.<br>Gambling has usually been associated with organized crime. Even today, when<br>government agencies supervise gambling, it would appear that there is still a crime<br>connection. This may be because many of the best gamblers and gambling<br>administrators learned their trade outside of the law. Besides this, gambling<br>establishments attract various forms of crime to the area.<br>Since law and government have an important educational function, one doesn't like to<br>see them involved in gambling. Governments should be more than profit-maximizers.<br>They should be concerned chiefly with the public good.<br>",

But the two<br>authors are known almost as well for their arguments and disagreements. The famous<br>partners were very different people with very different interests.<br>William S. Gilbert wrote the words that Sullivan set to music. Gilbert had a special talent<br>for humourous verse. He loved puns, and had a very quick wit. Personally though, he<br>was very businesslike. He had wanted to enter the military and always had the look of a<br>soldier about him. He was fond of giving orders and disliked criticism of anything he did.<br>Arthur S. Sullivan, on the other hand, was a sensitive, emotional person, whose main<br>interest was music. Sullivan came from a poor family, but his musical talents and good<br>looks had helped him to succeed. Sullivan wanted to write serious classical music. But,<br>as a poor man, he needed a source of income. Sullivan also needed someone to direct<br>him. On his own, he had trouble deciding what to do.<br>Gilbert and Sullivan never became really good friends and, at the end of their lives, they<br>had little contact with each other. But the writer and musician needed each other. Gilbert<br>needed a composer who could enliven his writings for the stage. Sullivan needed<br>someone to write a text for his music. Sullivan, who tended to be lazy, needed someone<br>to push him.<br>A theatrical manager named Richard D'Oyly Carte arranged their first collaboration.<br>Gilbert visited Sullivan and read him his satire on the legal system, @x@Trial by Jury.@x@<br>Sullivan loved the piece and quickly wrote the music. @x@Trial by Jury@x@ was produced in<br>1875 and became the first triumph for the partners.<br>D'Oyly Carte decided to form an acting company, which would stage future works by<br>Gilbert and Sullivan. A string of successes follows: @x@The Sorcerer@x@ in 1877; @x@H.M.S.<br>Pinafore@x@ in May 1878; @x@The Pirates of Penzance@x@ in December 1878; @x@Patience@x@ in 1881;<br>@x@Iolanthe@x@ in 1882; @x@The Mikado@x@ in 1885; @x@The Yeomen of the Guard@x@ in 1888; and @x@The<br>Gondoliers@x@ in 1889.<br>In spite of these successes, the two partners were not happy. Sullivan did not like the<br>way Gilbert dominated their relationship. Sullivan had to write music for Gilbert's scripts.<br>Why couldn't Gilbert write words for Sullivan's music? Gilbert, on the other hand,<br>thought that Sullivan got most of the credit for the success of their operettas and that he<br>was overlooked.<br>Gilbert was the driving force in the relationship. He was always writing new scripts and<br>taking them to Sullivan. It was Gilbert who rehearsed the actors and supervised the<br>productions. Sullivan had little to do with the actual performance. He usually did conduct<br>the orchestra on opening night.<br>The amazing thing is how these two different people produced such wonderful work.<br>Each separately had difficulty writing something that the public wanted. Together they<br>were unbeatable. Gilbert's sharp and often cutting remarks were made acceptable by<br>Sullivan's beautiful music. Gilbert's satire might have made people angry, but Sullivan's<br>music calmed them down. Even when the English people were the targets of Gilbert's<br>criticisms, the audience went out of the theatre humming these criticisms to Sullivan's<br>music.<br>",

Two volcanoes on the Island<br>of Hawaii are still active.<br>There are five larger islands. Kauai is to the west; Oahu, Molokai and Maui are in the<br>middle; and Hawaii is to the east. There are three smaller islands. Hawaii is the largest<br>island of the group, but Oahu has the largest population. The capital city, Honolulu, is on<br>Oahu.<br>Since the Hawaiian Islands are so far from any land, one might wonder how people<br>arrived there. The answer is that the first Hawaiians were very good sailors. They<br>travelled thousands of miles from other islands in the Pacific in canoes. To keep these<br>canoes stable in the ocean, they attached an @x@outrigger,@x@ or pontoon, to the main canoe.<br>Sometimes, they fastened two canoes together and put a wooden platform on top. Then<br>they could carry lots of people and supplies.<br>The first Hawaiians were Polynesians, and probably came from the Marguesas and Tahiti<br>in the South Pacific. They were a tall good-looking people. Their kings made rules about<br>how their people should live, and priests and advisors called @x@kahunas@x@ enforced these.<br>Today the phrase @x@the big kahuna@x@ means someone who is, or thinks he is, very<br>important.<br>Although Hawaii lies within the tropics, it has a very mild climate. Sea breezes keep the<br>weather from getting too hot, even in the summer. Many edible plants grow in abundance<br>there. So it was not difficult for the Hawaiians to live very comfortably without working<br>hard.<br>Captain Cook was the first European to reach Hawaii in 1778. Soon European and<br>American ships visited there regularly. The sailors also brought diseases formerly<br>unknown. By 1853, the population had dropped to 73,000 from about 300,000 when Cook<br>visited in 1778. Besides Europeans, people from China, Japan and the Philippines came<br>to live there. Soon large plantations of sugar cane and pineapples developed. As more<br>and more land came under western control, the native monarchy was undermined.<br>American plantation owners were able to arrange for United States' control of the islands.<br>Today, the largest industry is tourism. Since the climate is good all year round, visitors<br>can come at any time. When you arrive, a young Hawaiian woman will greet you. She will<br>put a beautiful flower necklace called a @x@lei@x@ around your neck. Hula dancers entertain<br>tourists. Hula dancers wear skirts made of long leaves. Each dancer tells a story by<br>moving their arms and hands in a certain way. For meals, the Hawaiians like to dig a pit in<br>the ground, place wood in the pit, and then set the wood on fire. Food wrapped in leaves<br>is then placed on the wood, and the pit is covered with leaves and mats. A feast cooked<br>this way is called a @x@luau.@x@ These traditions nowadays are usually performed for tourists,<br>or on special holidays. Hawaii is the 50th state of the United States, and its people enjoy<br>all the advantages of the modern world.<br>",

The automobile has thousands of parts<br>and it took a long time to make a really useful car. Henry Ford was one of the first people<br>to make a reliable automobile.<br>In 1765, James Watt invented the steam engine.

One had to<br>know how to repair a car oneself.<br>Henry Ford tried to make cars which would be affordable, and which would not break<br>down very easily. His Ford Motor Company was formed in 1903 in Detroit, Michigan.<br>Since many parts had to be brought together to make a car, Ford developed the assembly<br>line.

But it isn't clear ahead of time that these changes will make a<br>big overall improvement in a library, in the world, or in anything else.<br>Years ago, literary critics used to examine great writers very closely to find bad phrasing<br>or ungrammatical sentences. They would look at a play by Shakespeare and identify<br>lines that they didn't think were very good. Sometimes, they would suggest that these<br>lines were added by another writer, or that Shakespeare had written this part quickly<br>without much consideration. Sometimes, they would omit or improve on the lines. It is<br>doubtful that any of Shakespeare's plays were actually improved by these critics. An<br>entire play needs high points and low points, poetry and prose. The whole thing is<br>greater than all its individual parts.

It is not always the singer or musician who is flawless that we admire most.<br>Sometimes, it is the person whose performance is not perfect, but who puts a special<br>energy, feeling, or enthusiasm into their work that we admire.<br>It is true that little things can sometimes add up to a big difference. Changing a bad habit<br>can make a difference in your life, and in the lives of people around you. Giving up<br>smoking, for example, or ceasing to criticize a family member can make an important<br>difference. Sometimes, however, we are only looking at the symptoms of a larger<br>problem.<br>For example, nearly everyone would agree that giving up smoking is a good idea. But if<br>our smoking is related to emotional problems or stress in our lives, then giving up<br>smoking may make us feel even worse. It may be necessary to deal with the root problem.<br>It can happen too that being always on the look-out for ways to improve things may<br>become a problem in itself. @x@Perfectionism@x@ means never being satisfied with things as<br>they are. Especially if we are always criticizing people around us for not being good<br>enough, this can become a bad thing.<br>A popular saying in North America is, @x@If it ain't broke, don't fix it.@x@ This is a warning to<br>people who feel that their role or position involves making continuous changes in<br>policies, procedures, products or personnel. Sometimes, the drive for change can be<br>more of a personality problem than a genuine concern to make things better.<br>Real problems are often clearly apparent. Problems like world hunger, personality<br>conflicts, policies that don't work, poor levels of service, bad manners, and all kinds of<br>troubles are hard to ignore. They are also difficult to resolve. Perhaps that's one reason<br>why some people identify things as problems which are of concern to hardly anyone<br>except themselves.<br>Yes, we can make the world, and the reading room, better. But, we can also make them<br>worse. It takes a lot of discernment and usually some experience to know how to make a<br>particular thing better. There are so many things that could use improvement that it is<br>difficult to know where to start. This too requires some thought, not to mention prayer<br>and study. We can start by asking whether the thing we see as a problem is also a<br>problem for other people. If it isn't, then maybe our energy and attention might be better<br>employed elsewhere.<br>",

        Title: "John Chapman : American Pioneer",
        Content:
          "When the first Europeans came to North America, they found dense forests coming down<br>right to the shore. So thick were the forests that it is said that a squirrel could travel from<br>the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River without once touching the ground. Clearing<br>these trees to make room for fields and buildings was a very difficult task for the early<br>settlers.<br>Another difficulty was finding enough food in this new land. Many European crops would<br>not grow in this climate. Carrying and storing seeds over a long period was also risky.<br>Native Indians were often helpful in teaching the settlers how to find food. But sometimes<br>there were no Indians nearby, or they were hostile.<br>John Chapman is famous today because he helped the early settlers grow one important<br>product - apples. Apples could be eaten fresh in the fall, or stored through the winter.<br>They could be made into fresh apple juice or alcoholic cider. They could be dried, or<br>made into applesauce. Apples also could be made into vinegar, which was very useful for<br>keeping vegetables from spoiling.<br>John Chapman was born in Massachusetts in 1774, the year before the American<br>Revolution began. John's father joined George Washington's army to fight for American<br>independence from Great Britain. While the war was going on, John's mother died. In<br>1780, John's father married again, and soon John had lots of young brothers and sisters.<br>John probably worked on his father's farm as he was growing up. Then he worked on<br>neighbouring farms. It may be at this time that John began to learn about apples.<br>After the Revolutionary War, the population of the U.S.A. was expanding. Many<br>Americans wanted to go west over the mountains to find land in Indian Territory. In the<br>fall of 1797, young John Chapman headed west into Pennsylvania. On his way, he<br>gathered leftover apple seeds from the cider mills that he passed. As usual, John walked<br>barefoot, but as he travelled snow began to fall. He tore strips off his coat and tied them<br>around his feet. Then he made snowshoes out of tree branches. When he arrived in the<br>west, he began to clear land and plant apple seeds. This began a pattern that would last<br>Chapman's whole life. He would travel ahead of the settlers, clear land, and then sell his<br>baby apple trees to the settlers when they arrived. When the area became too settled,<br>Chapman would move further west, and start again.<br>Many settlers regarded John Chapman as a strange character. He never bought new<br>clothes, but wore whatever old clothes came his way. But he was always welcome at a<br>settler's cabin. John was good at clearing land, telling stories, and growing apples. He<br>liked children, and children liked him. He was a religious man and would read to the<br>settlers about God and living together peacefully.<br>At this time, there was conflict between the settlers and the Indians about land. John<br>managed to be friendly with both groups. But John did warn the settlers if the Indians<br>were planning to attack them.<br>Every fall, John went east to gather more apple seeds. Then he would go further west<br>and find some empty land to plant his seeds. During the warm weather, he tended all his<br>fields of baby apple trees. Once they were properly grown, he sold the seedlings to<br>settlers. When he had earned enough money, he bought land to grow more apple trees.<br>In his own lifetime, he became known as Johnny Appleseed. Legends grew up about him.<br>It was said that his bare feet could melt snow, and that he could leap across rivers.<br>Johnny Appleseed never built himself a real home. He was a wanderer all his life,<br>travelling west to Indiana and Iowa and back east again. He enjoyed sleeping outdoors,<br>lying on his back, looking up at the stars and thinking about God and his world.<br>He died in Indiana in 1845, and no one knows exactly where he is buried. But all through<br>that region are hundreds of apple trees. These apple trees are the most fitting memorial<br>to John Chapman - the legendary Johnny Appleseed.<br>",

        Content:
          "Nevada is a large state of deserts and mountains. Since most of the land is not suitable<br>for farming, the population grew very slowly. In the 1950s, there were only 267,000 people<br>in the entire state. Today, there are nearly a million people living in the Las Vegas area<br>alone.<br>Las Vegas has become a major tourist center. It used to be a quiet little desert town of<br>the old west. But in the 1950s and 1960s, hotels and gambling casinos were opened. In<br>order to bring tourists to town, these hotels hired well-known entertainers. Soon Las<br>Vegas became known as a major entertainment center.<br>In order to promote the growth of Nevada, some activities were allowed which were<br>against the law in other states. These included gambling and prostitution. It was also<br>easier to get married in Nevada than in some other states. Over time, many other<br>attractions were developed.<br>Much of the activity in Las Vegas goes on at some 30 major hotels. Many of these hotels<br>provide a complete range of services and entertainment. Some of them boast 4,000 or<br>5,000 rooms. It is common for these large hotels to be organized around a particular<br>theme, such as the Middle Ages, the Arabian Nights, the movies, the circus, Paris, Egypt<br>or the Far East. The hotel, its restaurants, shops, lounges and entertainment reflect this<br>theme. For example, the Paris Las Vegas Hotel has a 50-storey replica of the Eiffel Tower.<br>The Luxor Hotel has a huge image of an Egyptian Sphinx and a replica of the tomb of<br>King Tut.<br>Nearly all of the major hotels also contain a casino - sometimes several casinos.<br>Gambling is a major reason why people come to Las Vegas. There are slot machines,<br>blackjack tables, and roulette wheels and much more.<br>Even though Las Vegas is in the desert, there is an extravagant use of water. Large<br>swimming pools, water slides, artificial waterfalls and huge fountains are common.<br>Health spas, beauty salons, fashion boutiques, specialty restaurants and malls abound.<br>Tennis and golf are also popular.<br>The lavish shows at Las Vegas are world famous. The tall dancing showgirls, like the<br>famous Rockettes, wear beautiful but rather skimpy costumes. Some entertainers, like<br>singer Wayne Newton, rarely leave Las Vegas. The pay there is good, and the audiences<br>are appreciative.<br>Near Las Vegas are other tourist sites such as the giant Hoover Dam. Behind the Hoover<br>Dam is the large artificial lake, Lake Mead. Further up the river is the Grand Canyon. All<br>these things are a short trip from the city.<br>Las Vegas is called the city that never sleeps. At nearly any time of the day or night, there<br>are casinos and shows that are open. A monorail connects many of the leading hotels.<br>Many people view Las Vegas as a total entertainment package. One word of caution - set<br>yourself a limit to how much you will spend at the casinos. Gambling can be addictive.<br>",

        Content:
          "Women have often played an important role in war. They have worked in munitions<br>factories, made clothing and supplies, encouraged and entertained soldiers, nursed the<br>wounded, and acted as spies. It is rare, however, for a woman to have played a key role<br>in determining the course of a war. Many people believe that Laura Secord played such a<br>role in the War of 1812.<br>Laura Secord was born in the United States at the time of the American Revolution. Her<br>father had fought in the U.S. army against the British. But when land in the American<br>States became scarce, the family moved to Ontario, Canada, and so back under British<br>rule. Laura married into a pro-British family, and adopted their political views. So when<br>the War of 1812 broke out between Britain and America, her husband, James Secord,<br>joined the Canadian militia to defend Ontario against the Americans.<br>The American invasion of 1812 was defeated at Queenston Heights, and some of the<br>wounded were brought to Laura's house in nearby Queenston. Laura went out to the<br>battlefield where she found her husband, James, who was severely wounded, and<br>brought him home.<br>In 1813, the U.S. invasion was more successful. Parts of Ontario close to the U.S. border<br>were occupied by American troops. Local families were expected to provide room and<br>board for U.S. officers. It was sometimes possible, therefore, for Canadians to overhear<br>American officers discussing military strategy, either in their homes, or in the local<br>tavern.<br>The situation in Ontario looked desperate in the Spring of 1813. The whole province<br>seemed likely to fall into American hands. In June, Laura overheard talk of an American<br>attack on the British outpost at Beaver Dams. Her husband was still suffering from war<br>injuries, and she had to look after him and their children. Nevertheless, she resolved to<br>go to warn the British commander.<br>Possibly, Laura did not intend to walk the whole way herself. She hoped to be able to<br>pass on the news to someone else along the way. First, she would have to make up a<br>story to get past the American sentries. She left Queenston in early morning and walked<br>nineteen miles to the neighbourhood of Beaver Dams by nightfall. She still had to cross a<br>wide stream and climb up the Niagara Escarpment. There she came upon an<br>encampment of Indians who were assisting the British. Their war cries in the moonlight<br>terrified her, but she insisted on being taken to the British commander. Finally, one of the<br>chiefs escorted her to British headquarters, and she was able to tell Fitzgibbon the<br>American plan of attack.<br>When the Americans arrived in the neighbourhood of Beaver Dams, the Indians had<br>prepared an ambush for them. A running fight ensued between the American force of 570<br>soldiers and 450 Indians supporting the British. At this point, Fitzgibbon arrived with 50<br>British regulars. Seeing the Americans disorganized and surrounded by the Indians,<br>Fitzgibbon boldly demanded their surrender. By telling the American Commander<br>Boerstler that he was facing huge British and Indian forces, Fitzgibbon induced the<br>American leader to turn over his whole army to the British.<br>Although only small armies were involved at Beaver Dams, the battle had great<br>significance. Afterwards, the Americans stayed behind their walls for the rest of the year.<br>The U.S. government recalled their commander-in-chief. British and Canadian morale<br>increased, and Laura's home in Queenston was restored to British control.<br>Laura Secord's story was little known until 1860. She was an old woman in her eighties<br>when she was presented to the visiting Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. He<br>awarded a gift of money for her services. Her story then became famous; today her home<br>in Queenston, Ontario, is an historical museum and a popular tourist attraction.<br>",

        Content:
          "Much of the history of North America is about how Europeans moved westward from the<br>Atlantic coast towards the Pacific. The first settlements began around 1600, and it was a<br>long time before the Europeans settled the interior. By the late eighteenth century,<br>however, good farmland along the east coast was becoming scarce. As the population<br>increased, people began thinking about all the native Indian lands further inland.<br>Families were quite large in pioneer days, and the oldest son usually inherited the family<br>farm. This meant that the other sons and daughters would have to move away when their<br>parents died. Often the sons would want to begin their own farm, and start their own<br>family. But, if there was no farmland available, or if it was too expensive to buy, they were<br>out of luck. One option was to move west where land was free or very cheap.<br>Sometimes the whole family might move if their old farm was no longer productive.<br>Sometimes the old farm was on poor soil, or too much farming had exhausted the soil.<br>Perhaps better land could be had further west.<br>There were other reasons for moving west. Pioneer settlers depended on wild birds, fish<br>and wild animals for food, furs and skins for clothing and trading, and trees for building<br>materials. These things became scarce in old settled areas. Out west there were lots of<br>animals to hunt for food, and animal skins could be traded for supplies. It seemed that it<br>was easier to make a living on the frontier.<br>Of course, there were some problems regarding moving west. Various American Indian<br>tribes who might fight to defend their land occupied the land. Then the land needed to be<br>cleared of trees and stumps before it could be planted. A log cabin and other buildings<br>had to be built. A well had to be dug, or a spring of water found. Settlers might also suffer<br>because there were no doctors, or teachers, or stores available. These things, though,<br>often did follow closely behind the first settlers.<br>A series of @x@Little House@x@ books written by Laura Ingalls Wilder tells the story of her<br>pioneer family. The Ingalls family moved many times while Laura was a little girl. She was<br>born in Wisconsin in 1867; her family moved next year to Missouri; then they moved to<br>Kansas in 1869; the Ingalls moved back to Wisconsin in 1871; they moved to Minnesota<br>in 1874; her family went to Iowa in 1876; then back to Minnesota in 1877. Finally, they<br>moved to De Smet, South Dakota in 1879, and there the family remained.<br>All these moves were typical for a pioneer family - always on the lookout for better land<br>and other opportunities. But all these moves involved very hard work, all of which<br>seemed all lost when the family had to move again.<br>For example, when Laura's parents moved to the Kansas prairie in 1869, they had many<br>hardships. The family put all their belongings in a covered wagon, which measured four<br>feet by ten feet. Two horses pulled it, and the family dog followed along. Laura and her<br>sister Mary were very little girls.<br>The family and their wagon were nearly washed away trying to cross a small river. They<br>travelled through wild tall grass where there were no roads. Laura's father built a house<br>on the open prairie with logs he hauled from the creek bottoms. One of the nearby<br>settlers helped him. They also built a log stable for the horses. That was a good thing,<br>because the next night their little house was surrounded by a pack of fifty large wolves.<br>They formed a large circle around the house and howled all night.<br>One day while Laura's father was away, two Indians visited the house. They wanted<br>Laura's mother to feed them and stood silent while the food was cooking. The Indians<br>wore only fresh skunk skins as clothing. After the Indians had eaten all the food, they left.<br>The following spring, there was a large gathering of Indian tribes. Most of them wanted to<br>fight the settlers. For many nights, the sounds of Indian drums frightened the settlers.<br>One tribe opposed the plan, and finally the gathering broke up and the Indians went away.<br>Many other problems faced the Ingalls family. These included bad weather, prairie grass<br>fires, and malaria. The worst part was having to leave their new homes. The government<br>decided that Laura's family was living on Indian land and would have to move. So the<br>covered wagon was packed again, and the family travelled north. Such experiences were<br>not unusual for pioneers in the nineteenth century.<br>",

        Content:
          "Mutiny is a word that has brought fear to the most powerful empires in the world. Mutiny<br>is when soldiers and sailors refuse to obey their commanders, often killing or<br>imprisoning them. Mutiny can spread through whole armies and navies, throwing<br>governments into crisis. No wonder that nations have always taken harsh measures to<br>punish mutinous leaders. The ancient Romans executed every tenth man from an army<br>unit that had mutinied. In the British navy, mutineers were normally hanged. However,<br>one of history's most famous mutinies did not happen to a whole army or navy, it<br>happened on a single small ship, H.M.S. Bounty.<br>H.M.S. Bounty set sail from England in December 1787. It was a small cramped vessel,<br>uncomfortable during a long voyage. Its goal was to sail to the South Pacific and bring<br>back Tahitian breadfruit plants. The government hoped that breadfruit would provide a<br>cheap food for black slaves in the British West Indies.<br>The captain of the Bounty was William Bligh, a veteran of many voyages. His crew,<br>however, was largely made up of inexperienced young men. There was no room on the<br>ship for soldiers or marines, so Bligh, as the only commissioned officer, had the difficult<br>task of maintaining order.<br>After a long and difficult trip, the Bounty finally arrived in Tahiti in October 1788. Free<br>from the constraints of life aboard ship, the young men enjoyed life on the tropical island<br>with the friendly natives. Many of the sailors established relationships with island women.<br>Meanwhile, the collection of breadfruit plants for the homeward voyage continued.<br>In April 1789, Captain Bligh decided that it was time to return to England. The breadfruit<br>plants were loaded on the deck, making the ship cramped indeed. The Bounty set sail<br>and would no doubt have reached England again, except for the turmoil in the mind of<br>one of its young officers.<br>Fletcher Christian was 24 years old, of dark complexion, and from a good family. As the<br>Bounty pulled further from Tahiti, Fletcher seemed to have decided that he didn't want to<br>return to England. Tahiti had been an earthly paradise, and now long months of<br>discomfort aboard ship awaited him. He was too far from Tahiti to return by himself. He<br>would need the Bounty.<br>On April 28, 1789, some of Fletcher Christian's friends seized control of the ship. Captain<br>Bligh and eighteen sailors who supported him were put in a small open boat with limited<br>food and water. Meanwhile, Christian and his 24 followers sailed back to Tahiti.<br>Eventually, Fletcher Christian would sail the Bounty to the uninhabited Pitcairn Islands,<br>far to the south of the shipping lanes.<br>Meanwhile, Bligh and his loyal followers sailed in their open boat almost the width of the<br>Pacific Ocean. They suffered from thirst, hunger and sickness, as well as hostile natives.<br>Finally, they reached Timor in Indonesia in June and eventually made their way to the<br>capital, Batavia.<br>When they returned to England, Captain Bligh was first greeted as a hero. Soon, however,<br>public attitudes changed.<br>The legend began that Bligh was a cruel tyrant who had caused the mutiny by harsh<br>treatment of his men. Although Bligh had a temper, and was not very tactful, this does<br>not appear to be the whole story. In fact, it is the controversy over who is to blame for the<br>mutiny - Bligh or Christian - that has kept the story alive for more than 200 years.<br>",

        Content:
          "When people think of rainforests, they usually think of the tropical jungle. But heavy rain<br>can also produce dense forests in temperate areas. Along the northwest coast of North<br>America, there are some of the largest trees in the world. This forest runs along the<br>Pacific Coast from Alaska down to northern California. About half of it is in British<br>Columbia, Canada.<br>Several species of trees grow to an immense size. Some grow up to 95 metres (312 feet)<br>high, and 12 metres (40 feet) in circumference. They may be as much as 1,000 years old.<br>Because the trees are so tall, the forest has various levels of growth. Small plants attach<br>themselves to the tall trees and may form a kind of garden in the air. Further down are<br>the tops of the younger trees. Closer to the ground are shrubs and bushes. Along the<br>ground are moss, ferns, berries and other plants.<br>These old forests have developed over several thousand years. The tall trees are at least<br>several hundred years old. This old forest has several special features. Some of the dead<br>tall trees remain standing and become homes for insects, birds and small animals. Trees<br>that fall to the ground can become @x@nurse logs@x@ for new plants or trees to grow on. Trees<br>that fall across rivers and streams can provide natural dams, which provide quiet water<br>for animals to live in.<br>In recent years, it has become common for logging companies to @x@clear-cut@x@ this old<br>forest. To clear-cut a forest means to go into a section of forest with heavy machinery<br>and cut down every tree. Sometimes, these @x@clear-cuts@x@ are as large as some European<br>countries. Logging companies are doing this because it is a cheap method of logging.<br>The problem is that when an old forest is cut, it does not grow back again. Even with<br>replanting, companies produce a tree farm, not an old forest. The complexity of an old<br>forest, which grew over thousands of years, is lost forever. The old forest can shelter<br>many kinds of birds, mammals, fish and plants that a replanted forest cannot.<br>Another issue is that companies are cutting more and more old forests because they<br>haven't done enough replanting. As long as governments have been willing to let<br>companies cut old forests, neither logging companies nor governments have been much<br>motivated to replant the forests. As a result, most of the old forest has been cut down<br>and continues to be cut at a rapid rate.<br>This situation has also worsened because new technology allows more rapid logging.<br>Clear-cut logging results in erosion, which, in turn, damages the quality of rivers and<br>streams. This causes a decline in the salmon fishery. Animals like grizzly bears, elk and<br>deer are harmed by the loss of habitat. Likewise, birds that nest in the old forest, such as<br>bald eagles, owls, woodpeckers and various seabirds are being threatened.<br>Recently, public interest in the old rainforests has resulted in an increase in tourism.<br>People come to see these spectacular trees and the many plants and animals that<br>depend on them. We hope that these unique temperate rainforests will remain for many<br>more generations to enjoy.<br>",

        Content:
          "Why do people travel hundreds of miles to look at beautiful scenery? And why does one<br>particular place attract many more visitors than similar places not far away? Peggy's<br>Cove in Nova Scotia, Canada, is one of those special spots that draws people from all<br>over the world. It is hard to explain its special charm, but any one who has been there<br>will know what I am talking about.<br>The southern-eastern shore of Nova Scotia possesses many picturesque fishing villages<br>and many beautiful seascapes. But one doesn't have to go very far from the capital city<br>of Halifax to see this special spot. There are no trees around Peggy's Cove. The<br>dominant feature are huge round granite rocks, many of them the size of houses. They<br>seem to be pushing up and out of the land and sea. Nestled inside the circle of these<br>rocks is a group of fishing huts. Now and then a fishing boat leaves by the little bay or<br>cove, in order to travel out into the great Atlantic Ocean.<br>For nearly two hundred years, there have been fishermen at Peggy's Cove. All around the<br>little harbour there are huts or @x@fish stores@x@ where the fishermen do their work. Here they<br>bring in the fish, and clean them, wash them and salt them. The salted fish are then<br>stored in barrels. Nowadays, however, more fish are sold fresh than salted.<br>Visiting as a tourist, I wandered into one of these huts while the fisherman was busy at<br>his work. He explained to me that, although Peggy's Cove is a tourist destination, it is<br>also a working fishing village. The fishermen get no money from the tourists, but have to<br>take the time to talk to them and explain their work. There are, however, some tourist<br>shops and tea rooms in the vicinity.<br>Part of the charm of Peggy's Cove is that it is so small. The population has been well<br>under 100 people for most of its history. The buildings are mostly small dwellings, with<br>the lighthouse being the most prominent structure.<br>A good variety of fish are caught in the area, including mackerel, herring, haddock, cod<br>and halibut. Lobsters are also trapped nearby. However, because of over-fishing, catches<br>have declined in recent decades.<br>The plants and animals of the area are also of interest. Showy purple lupins grow close<br>to the ocean. They thrive on salty ground, and the closer they grow to the spray of the<br>ocean the better. One of the world's few carnivorous plants - the common pitcher plant -<br>also grows around Peggy's Cove. Its leaves trap insects, which are digested to nourish<br>the plant.<br>Common birds are the stately blue heron, which likes to fish in the marshy pools. The<br>heron stands several feet high and spear fish and frogs with its sharp beak. Another bird<br>is the osprey, or fish hawk. The osprey's keen eyes can spot a fish moving beneath the<br>surface of the water. It can dive swiftly, hitting the water with great speed, catch the fish<br>in its claws, and then fly away with its catch.<br>I have also seen pools close to the ocean full of large tadpoles. These tadpoles spend<br>several years in the water before they develop into bullfrogs. Bullfrogs, the largest<br>Canadian frog, have been know to eat baby ducks and small fish.<br>Looking over the little harbour and out toward the great ocean, one notices the contrast<br>between the very small and the very large. If Peggy's Cove were larger, it would be more<br>ordinary. As it is, it represents all the little fishing villages, where men have gone forth in<br>little boats to fish on the wide ocean.<br>",

        Title: "Prince Edward Island",
        Content:
          "Throughout history, people have dreamed about a special place, remote from the day-to-<br>day business world. Sometimes, they have thought of this place as an enchanted world<br>where the weather is always good, and food is always easy to get. Sometimes, it has<br>been a hidden valley in the mountains, or an island far out at sea. When the Europeans<br>arrived in the South Pacific, they thought that they had found it. Islands such as Tahiti<br>seemed about as perfect as possible. Nowadays, our cities grow larger and larger, and<br>people have to work harder and harder to succeed. Many people would like to escape to<br>a quieter, slower, more peaceful, more attractive environment.<br>When summer holidays come, many people travel to Prince Edward Island in Eastern<br>Canada. It has a mild summer climate, and hardly ever gets too hot or dry. The fields,<br>trees, and crops stay green all summer. In fact, P.E.I. is famous for the many shades of<br>green on the island. Its soil and dirt roads are red because of iron oxide in the soil. And<br>visitors are never far away from the blue waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In late June<br>and early July, the roadsides are covered with large purple flowers called lupins. The<br>vivid colours of P.E.I. help make the province a photographer's paradise.<br>Prince Edward Island is almost 100 miles long and about 20 miles wide. It is small<br>enough that a tourist can see much of the Island in a couple of days. But there are<br>enough interesting things to see and do that most people like to stay longer.<br>One of the chief traditional occupations is fishing. At one time, fishing was an important<br>source of food and income for many islanders. Now the fisheries are in decline; boat<br>owners find it more profitable to take tourists out to fish than to fish themselves.<br>Lobsters and shellfish are still important to the Island, which is famous for its @x@lobster<br>suppers.@x@ Tourists can visit many picturesque little fishing villages all around the<br>coastline.<br>Farming is also important. P.E.I. is famous for its potatoes, which are exported all over<br>the world. Dairy farming is also common, and local ice cream is popular with tourists.<br>Apple orchards, grain fields, hay fields, and vegetable gardening are also widely found.<br>During the era of sailing ships, a lot of shipbuilding took place on the Island. But as steel<br>hulls replaced wooden hulls, shipbuilding moved to regions where steel was being<br>produced. The full impact of the industrial revolution has never hit P.E.I. Farming, fishing<br>and tourism have remained the chief industries. There are no large cities on the Island.<br>So, if young people want to go to the big city, they have to leave P.E.I. The majority of<br>Island people prefer to live in small towns and villages, just as their ancestors did.<br>Since there wasn't much industry on the Island, many people did not have a lot of money.<br>As a result, they @x@made do@x@ with their old houses, old furniture, and old ways of doing<br>things. This is why visitors to P.E.I. sometimes feel like they are going back in time.<br>Things on the Island seem like they are still the way things were in our parents' or<br>grandparents' day.<br>Most of the people who live on the Island are descended from British immigrants in the<br>eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. The majority of these were from Scotland, and the<br>Scottish heritage remains strong. There are also some Micmac Indians and some French<br>Canadians, or Acadians. The Island has generally avoided social and political strife, and<br>this contributes to the peaceful atmosphere.<br>Islanders welcome people @x@from away@x@ as tourists. However, some say that to be a true<br>Islander, you have to be born on the Island. Nonetheless, some tourists have fallen in<br>love with P.E.I. and have gone there to live.<br>A couple of years ago, a bridge was built to connect the Island with the mainland. Many<br>opposed this @x@fixed link,@x@ saying that it would destroy the special P.E.I. atmosphere. It<br>remains to be seen whether the Island will change, now that tourists can drive directly on<br>to the rich, red soil.<br>",

        Content:
          "Public transportation in North America varies greatly from place to place. Some large<br>cities like New York, Boston, Toronto and Montreal have subway systems. These same<br>cities usually also have train service into the city. But most towns and cities do not have<br>subways or trains. Some do not even have buses. Most big cities have some sort of<br>public bus service.<br>In most North American cities, people who use the buses complain about poor service.<br>This is partly because most people prefer to drive a car. Automobile companies spend<br>billions of dollars on advertising. They want to convince young people that they should<br>drive a car as soon as they are old enough. Even when public transportation is very good,<br>most North Americans prefer to drive cars. So mostly students, poor people and seniors<br>use buses.<br>The large car companies have a lot of economic and political power in North America.<br>They can usually convince politicians to limit the money put into public transit. Lobbying<br>by large car companies has been effective in closing down many railway lines. In some<br>cases, large corporations have bought train tracks, and torn them up so that no one<br>could use them again. Because of this, nearly all transportation in North America is by<br>car, bus or truck.<br>The automobile created the modern North American city. Cars allowed families to live<br>outside the city and drive back in to work. Since the 1920s, large numbers of Americans<br>have lived in the suburbs, and used cars to do nearly all their daily activities. People<br>drive to school, to work, to the shopping mall, to the theatre, to church and to doctors,<br>lawyers and dentists. Because the modern city is so spread out, it is difficult to get where<br>you want to go by walking, or even by bicycling.<br>But the automobile also causes problems. Car accidents are a major cause of death and<br>injury. Crowded streets and snarled traffic can lead to road rage. Frustrated drivers<br>sometimes get out of their cars to fight each other. Young people often use cars as super<br>toys. They enjoy driving very fast and take risks while driving. A high proportion of<br>serious accidents concern drivers using alcohol or drugs. More recently, some people<br>have accused cell phones of being a cause of accidents.<br>About half of the air pollution in North American cities is caused by motor vehicles. The<br>exhaust fumes from cars and trucks are part of this. The other part is that vehicles erode<br>the surface of the highways. Small particles are torn loose from the road and thrown into<br>the air as cars whiz by. Heavy trucks are particularly large contributors to particle<br>pollution.<br>Especially in hot weather, a layer of smog covers many cities. Much of this is caused by<br>motor vehicles. Because city roads are often crowded, the result is frequent traffic jams.<br>When cars are moving very slowly, bumper to bumper, it adds to air pollution.<br>Another problem with cars is that not everyone can afford one. The average car costs<br>nearly $20,000 to buy, and about $4,000 a year to operate. So cars are also a status<br>symbol. People with cars tend to move out of the city. As a result, downtown areas are<br>usually where the poorer people live.<br>For a long time, many people have said that governments should try to make downtown<br>areas more attractive to live in. This would include improving public transit, into and<br>inside, the cities. Then some people may move back from the suburbs. And air pollution<br>levels will decline.<br>Right now, the large automobile companies and oil companies oppose these measures.<br>Recently, there have been cuts to public transit in many cities. Whether these cuts<br>continue, or whether they get reversed, is a big political issue in North America today.<br>",

        Content:
          "The story of Anne Shirley, the red-haired orphan, has been popular around the world for<br>almost a century. The opening chapters of @x@Anne of Green Gables@x@ tell how a brother and<br>sister, living together on a farm, have decided to adopt a boy. Matthew Cuthbert is now<br>60 years old and needs help working the farm. They have sent away to the orphanage,<br>and the boy will be arriving by train.<br>When Matthew goes to the train station with his horse and buggy, there is no boy, only a<br>girl-- Ann Shirley. Anne is no ordinary girl. She has a vivid imagination and loves to talk<br>about things that interest her. Matthew, who is shy and quiet, takes an immediate liking<br>to her. When they arrive home, however, his sister Marilla is very upset. She doesn't see<br>what good a girl would be to them. Matthew says, @x@We might be some good to her.@x@<br>After a while, Marilla begins to feel sorry for the thin little orphan and decides to keep her.<br>But Marilla finds that teaching Anne how to behave properly is quite a challenge. Anne<br>often does things without thinking first, and Marilla has to be vigilant to keep her out of<br>trouble. As time goes by, Anne becomes accepted in the community and doesn't get into<br>as many difficulties.<br>One characteristic of the little orphan is a love of big words. While she lived a life of hard<br>work, Anne liked to imagine beautiful things that she didn't have. This was her way of<br>dealing with unhappiness when she worked as a servant for unkind people. Living at<br>Green Gables makes her happy, but she doesn't lose her love of special words or<br>beautiful things.<br>Anne is also unhappy because she has red hair and freckles. In Anne's day, beautiful<br>women were thought to have light clear complexions and black hair. Her colouring<br>seemed unromantic. However, red hair and freckles are very common on Prince Edward<br>Island, where many of the people are of Scottish descent.<br>This story tells us a lot about how to be happy. When Matthew and Marilla stop worry<br>about needing a boy, and start taking care of Anne, they find that they enjoy having her<br>around. Their lives become much more interesting now that they have someone who<br>needs them. So happiness involves looking after others, and being needed by them.<br>There were many stories about orphans when @x@Anne of Green Gables@x@ was written.<br>Before modern medicine, many parents died before their children were grown up. A lot of<br>mothers died in childbirth. Since fathers didn't usually try to raise young children in<br>those days, someone else had to take the responsibility.<br>This is what happened to Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of @x@Anne.@x@ Her mother died<br>when she was a baby, and her father left her with her mother's parents. Montgomery's<br>grandparents provided a good home for her, but they were very strict and stern and<br>didn't have a lot of sympathy with the little girl.<br>In her story, Montgomery is imagining how she would have liked her own life to have<br>happened. What if her grandparents had been more like Matthew and Marilla? What if<br>they had allowed her to do more of the things she wanted to do? Wouldn't she have been<br>happier then?<br>The story shows how young children are hurt by bad treatment from the adults looking<br>after them. Even if the adults don't mean to be unkind, sometimes they say or do things<br>that make children very unhappy. @x@Anne@x@ teaches parents and grandparents to<br>encourage their children and help them to be happy and successful.<br>Anne Shirley is one little person who changes a whole community and makes it better.<br>We all have special gifts and talents, and if we are allowed to use those abilities, they will<br>benefit everyone around us.<br>",

        Title: "Romance Novels",
        Content:
          "Novels are imaginary stories about people and events. They are written to entertain and<br>amuse. Two thousand years ago, Greek writers told tales of young lovers. Usually the<br>lovers were separated by terrible events and were reunited only after much hardship and<br>suffering. This plot idea is still in use today.<br>The most popular books for women today in North America are romance novels. Many<br>millions are sold every year. This means that romance publishing is big business and<br>very competitive. Companies survey their readers to determine the kinds of stories they<br>like. One survey asked readers whether or not they would like more references to sex in<br>their novels. Usually, romances are about love, not sex. But in today's market, publishers<br>are ready to give their readers what they want.<br>The essence of the romance is to create suspense by putting obstacles in the way of the<br>lovers. One simple obstacle is to make the hero and the heroine as different as possible.<br>For example, an Eastern schoolteacher meets a Western cowboy. Of course, at first they<br>don't like each other at all; but in time, they fall in love. Or a female social worker might<br>meet an aggressive businessman.<br>Quite often the heroine is a spinster who has sworn never to marry. Or perhaps she has a<br>special dislike for the hero and his family. The romance writer must come up with a<br>plausible way to bring the two together. There are a number of popular plots that lead to<br>marriage. Sometimes, the heroine - out of a sense of duty - will move in with the hero to<br>help him raise his children. Or she may be a professional nanny who moves in with a<br>widower.<br>A favourite plot is the marriage of convenience. Two people who don't like each other get<br>married for financial or political reasons, or for the sake of the children. Later, of course,<br>they fall in love. In most cases, there is some particular obstacle to marriage. Often either<br>the hero or the heroine already has children, and he or she doesn't expect that anyone<br>will want to take on their ready-made family. Sometimes, one or the other has a physical<br>disability, or is of a different race, class, or background. For example, the heroine may<br>come from a very strict and proper family, while the hero may have a dubious reputation,<br>or even be a criminal. The interest of the story lies in how these very different people<br>come together.<br>Usually, the hero is a very masculine type - a cowboy, engineer, military man, pirate,<br>gambler, etc. The heroine is usually very female, but may have tomboy or spinster traits.<br>She frequently has a strong personality and a temper and is described as feisty or fiery.<br>A good example of the two types is Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in @x@Gone With the<br>Wind.@x@<br>Nearly every romance novel will contain some promotional offer to encourage readers to<br>order more books. Romances can be addictive, and some women read them almost non-<br>stop. Some romances are very well written, but the majority follows a set formula. That<br>way, the reader always knows what to expect.<br>",

        Content:
          "At one time in North America, most people shopped downtown on Main Street. Most<br>businesses were at the center of town. When people started using automobiles, however,<br>they moved away from downtown. In time, most people lived in the suburbs. Eventually,<br>stores and small shopping plazas were built in suburban areas. Still, most of the big<br>stores were downtown.<br>But as more and more cars were on the roads, driving and parking downtown became a<br>problem. There wasn't room for a lot of cars to park downtown. People also didn't want to<br>fight downtown traffic just to go shopping. So in the 1950s and 1960s, there was the<br>beginning of large suburban shopping malls and plazas.<br>Plazas were a row of stores attached to one another. Malls were usually a double row of<br>stores with a roof connecting both rows. This means that shoppers did all their shopping<br>inside. Large department stores and grocery stores were usually part of the mall, but<br>there were many smaller stores as well.<br>When you came to the mall and went inside, many people would get a shopping cart. You<br>can walk along the aisles, putting your purchases in the cart. When you are finished<br>shopping, you can push your shopping buggy out to the car. Many malls also have<br>buggies or strollers for pushing small children along.<br>There can be a lot of walking in a trip to the mall. In fact, some people go to the mall just<br>to exercise. A half dozen laps around the mall every morning amount to a pretty good<br>workout. However, there are always places to sit down when you get tired.<br>Most malls have a food court. This is an open area with a lot of tables and chairs. Usually<br>there are a dozen or more small restaurants circled around the food court. The<br>department stores often have full-size restaurants.<br>Malls have large parking lots. Unlike downtown, you don't pay to park at the mall. On a<br>busy day, finding a space close to the store can be a challenge.<br>Many people go to the malls when the weather is bad. During wintry weather, the malls<br>are busy. Likewise, in really hot summer weather, people go to the malls to get cool. The<br>climate there is always the same.<br>People don't go to the malls just to shop. They also go to meet people. Usually, you<br>bump into friends and neighbours there. Old people, as well as teenagers, go there to<br>see friends. Usually the malls sponsor special events. With lots to see and do, malls are a<br>popular place to @x@hang out.@x@<br>",

        Content:
          "Before radio and television, movies and recordings, entertainment was often a family or<br>community matter. Someone in the family could play a musical instrument, or a<br>neighbourhood musician would play for small gatherings. In addition, there would be<br>travelling groups of musicians, actors and clowns who would go from town to town.<br>In nineteenth century United States, one of the most popular forms of entertainment was<br>the minstrel show. Black slavery was still permitted in the southern states until 1865.<br>Even after that date, the lives of many blacks working on large farms or plantations did<br>not change much. They did hard physical labour in the fields, had little control over their<br>lives, and very little time to relax with their friends. Foster, who was born in 1826, made<br>this situation the background for many of his songs.<br>White musicians would try to imagine the feelings of black men and women working on<br>the plantations. They would write songs in the dialect or speech patterns that they<br>thought black slaves used. In these songs, the black people would be talking about their<br>hardships, falling in love, playing music and dancing, and finally growing old and dying.<br>White performers would blacken their faces and sing these songs to white audiences.<br>They would play musical instruments, like the banjo, a small four-stringed guitar, which<br>black people played often.<br>As a small boy, Stephen Foster had sometimes been taken to a black church by his<br>family's black servant, Olivia Pise. Here he first heard the melodies that inspired his own<br>songs. Only a couple of Foster's songs are based directly on @x@Negro spirituals;@x@ but<br>many of his songs have the natural simplicity and emotional power of folk songs.<br>The youngest member of a large family, Foster showed his musical talent at an early age.<br>He played the flute, violin, and piano. Growing up in an energetic business family,<br>Stephen was expected to become a businessman. And, for a while, he worked as a<br>bookkeeper. All his spare time, however, was spent writing songs.<br>Foster attended minstrel shows and tried to get the performers to sing his songs.<br>Sometimes the performers would steal his songs and publish them under their own<br>names. Copyright laws were weak and rarely enforced, so some music publishers would<br>just go ahead and publish a song without paying the songwriter. Since Foster hoped to<br>make a living as a songwriter, this was a problem.<br>Foster's first hit song was @x@Oh! Susanna@x@ published in 1848. It became popular with the<br>thousands of men from all over the United States who were heading west to the<br>Californian gold-rush of 1849. Unfortunately, as an unknown song writer, Foster received<br>no money from his early songs. He seems to have given them outright to the music<br>publishers, just to establish his reputation.<br>Foster's name, however, was soon widely known, and in 1849 he was able to afford to<br>give up bookkeeping, and marry the daughter of a Pittsburgh physician. During the next<br>five years, he earned a moderately good income from songwriting. In 1851, a daughter<br>Marion was born. Foster wrote many of his best-known songs at this time - @x@Old Folks at<br>Home@x@ in 1851; @x@My Old Kentucky Home@x@ in 1853, and @x@Jeanie With the Light Brown<br>Hair@x@ in 1854.<br>Difficulties in Foster's marriage began fairly soon. These may have been partly due to his<br>strange work habits. He spent days locked in his room working on his songs. Then he<br>would rush out with his materials to the local music store, presumably to test out the<br>songs on his friends. He also became more and more addicted to alcohol. Eventually, his<br>wife and daughter left him. Foster died alone in a rooming house in 1864.<br>Immigrants to the United States brought their traditional folk songs with them. However,<br>there were very few typically American songs. Foster provided many songs that<br>expressed the life of nineteenth century U.S.A. His songs were easy to sing, and were<br>popular with nearly everyone. In a sense, Foster helped to create roots for American<br>popular music.<br>",

Sunday closing has a<br>Christian origin. Christians believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on a Sunday<br>morning. So Sunday is known as the @x@Lord's Day.@x@<br>About 30 or 35% of North Americans attend church regularly on Sunday mornings. About<br>the same percentage attend church occasionally. At Christmas and Easter the churches<br>are very full, as people celebrate these two important holy days. Nearly everybody goes<br>to church at least three times. They are baptized or dedicated as a child. Most people are<br>married in a church, and many people are buried after a church service.<br>Church services are usually held Sunday mornings, often at 11:00 am, although there<br>may also be evening services provided. Most services last an hour. Their purpose is to<br>worship God and to help people focus on religious and moral beliefs.<br>The service is led by a pastor, minister or priest who usually also looks after the people<br>and the business of the church. It is the pastor who delivers the sermon, a twenty-minute<br>talk on a religious or moral matter. Usually members take part in the service. They may<br>lead the singing, read from the Bible, offer prayers for the congregation, take up the<br>collection, or act as ushers. Most churches also have a choir, a group of singers who<br>lead in singing the hymns.<br>There are many cultural traditions connected to going to church. People normally wear<br>their best clothing, and try to be on their best behaviour. Talking or making noise in<br>church is usually considered bad. This is why children often have a separate @x@children's<br>church@x@ or Sunday school, where they can be more like children.<br>The Sunday service is the main weekly event at many churches. But nowadays there are<br>a growing number of large @x@super-churches@x@ which organize all kinds of activities for<br>their members. These churches usually have large buildings and a large staff to plan and<br>lead various activities.

These are small<br>groups of people who meet at private homes. Sometimes a group will meet in a house<br>until they have the money to buy a church. But many people say they prefer to meet in<br>small groups. That way, they get to know one another better. Then they feel comfortable<br>sharing their problems and successes, and praying for each other. Some say that large<br>churches can interfere with getting close to God and other Christians.<br>There are many different @x@brands@x@ of Christianity. The largest single denomination in<br>North America is Roman Catholicism. Other large Christian @x@brands@x@ are Episcopalian,<br>Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran and Presbyterian. All have slightly different<br>traditions and beliefs.<br>Although in the past, these groups have often been in conflict with one another, today<br>they usually cooperate in working together for their members and the community.<br>",

          "Thanksgiving Day has a special meaning for Americans. Many holidays were brought<br>along from Europe by the early settlers, and didn't change very much. But Thanksgiving<br>takes on a special shape in North America. That is because of the Thanksgiving<br>celebrated by the early pilgrim settlers in Massachusetts in 1621.<br>These early settlers were from England and they were known as Puritans. This is<br>because they wanted to purify the state religion of England. They felt that the churches<br>were more concerned with politics and customs than God and worship. They were also<br>called Pilgrims, because they were willing to travel to other countries in order to worship<br>God the way they wanted to.<br>When the English government put some of the Pilgrims in jail, the rest left England and<br>went to the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, they could have their own churches.<br>However, it was hard to earn a living there, and at first they didn't know the language. In<br>time, the English king learned where they were and tried to have them arrested. So they<br>thought of another plan.<br>Pilgrim leaders like William Brewster attempted to raise money to start a colony in North<br>America. They would have to borrow money and pay it back later. Thirty members of the<br>Pilgrim church in the Netherlands voted to sail to America with their families. They<br>returned to England and set sail on two ships, the Speedwell and the Mayflower. When<br>the Speedwell appeared unable to cross the ocean, both ships returned to England. All<br>who still wanted to sail crowded into the Mayflower and set sail on September 6, 1620.<br>Many of the passengers became sick during the long voyage, and some died. They<br>encountered fierce storms because they were sailing late in the season.<br>After sixty-six days, they sighted the sandy shoreline of Cape Cod, in present-day<br>Massachusetts. There was disagreement between the Pilgrims and others on board ship<br>about what to do. So first they had to agree to a common form of government and elect a<br>governor. Since winter was coming, they decided to stay on the ship till spring.<br>About half of the remaining settlers died during that first winter. When the Mayflower<br>sailed back to England, only about fifty settlers were left. Nearly half of these were<br>children.<br>There were Indians in Massachusetts, but at first they were not friendly. They shot arrows<br>at the settlers. But one day a friendly Indian named Samoset came to visit them. He<br>spoke English and could tell them many things. He brought another Indian named<br>Squanto, who showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn. Eventually, their chief Massosoit<br>came, and he promised to keep peaceful relations with the settlers.<br>All spring and summer of 1621, the Pilgrims worked hard in the fields. They also finished<br>building houses and barns. In the fall, they were delighted to see that the corn and<br>vegetables had grown well. They decided to have a thanksgiving feast and invited their<br>Indian friends.<br>On the day of the feast, Chief Massosoit came with ninety Indians. There were turkeys,<br>deer meat and fish to eat. The feast lasted three days. When the food ran low, the Indians<br>went out to shoot more birds and animals.<br>The Pilgrims and Indians competed in races, wrestling, shooting and other games. The<br>Pilgrims addressed prayers and thanks to God for providing food, shelter, freedom of<br>religion and friendly Indians in this new land.<br>Ever since 1621, Thanksgiving celebrations include memories of that special occasion.<br>Today, turkeys, cranberries, corn and squash are usually part of the Thanksgiving meal.<br>In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday. It is celebrated every year on<br>the fourth Thursday in November.<br>In Canada, where the harvest is earlier, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second<br>Monday of October. The celebration always includes giving thanks for the good things<br>that people have received, especially for food and families. Along with this goes the<br>Thanksgiving meal, when so many good things are eaten.<br>",

        Title: "The Calgary Stampede",
        Content:
          "The @x@Wild West,@x@ as we know it from Hollywood westerns, did not last a long time. Its<br>height was from about 1865 to 1885, or only twenty years. By 1885, there were railways<br>across the plains, fences had been built around farms and ranches and lawmen were on<br>the lookout for any troublemakers. Not only that, but by 1885 nearly all the buffalo had<br>been killed, and most of the Indians were on reservations.<br>Still the @x@Wild West' had captured the imagination of the reading public. A former buffalo<br>hunter and Indian scout, Buffalo Bill Cody, decided to take advantage of his fame as a<br>cowboy. In 1883, he organized @x@Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show,@x@ and toured North America<br>and Europe.<br>Alberta, Canada had been the last part of the old west to be settled. But by 1912,<br>ranching was being replaced by farming. The city of Calgary was itself becoming a<br>commercial and industrial center. Old-timers looked back fondly to the old days of<br>cowboys and Indians.<br>In 1908, the Miller Brothers' Wild West Show visited Calgary. One of the cowboys, Guy<br>Weadick, talked to local businessmen about putting on a rodeo and the Wild West Show.<br>Eventually, four Calgary businessmen put up $25,000 each to finance the event.<br>Weadick was a good organizer. He advertised all over the U.S. and the Canadian west for<br>cowboys and rodeo-riders to come. And with $25,000 in prize money, people came from<br>as far away as Mexico. Weadick was able to persuade the Canadian government to let<br>large numbers of Indians leave their reservations to attend. In fact, the Indians were a big<br>part of the program.<br>The main rodeo events were bronco riding, bareback riding, women's bronco riding,<br>steer roping and bulldogging. These events were based on things that working cowboys<br>actually did. But to make them harder, special bucking horses were brought in. One<br>horse named Cyclone had never been ridden long by anyone. He had thrown 127 riders<br>in a row.<br>Most of the rodeo cowboys came from the United States - from Wyoming, Oregon,<br>Oklahoma, Colorado and Arizona. But there were also Canadian cowboys and some<br>Canadian Indians competing.<br>Queen Victoria's son, the Duke of Connaught, was the grand marshal. Many cowboys<br>rode well, but no one could stay on Cyclone. On the sixth and final day, the grounds were<br>muddy from rain, and the horses kept slipping. Cyclone escaped from his handlers and<br>ran around the track. For this last bronco-riding contest, Cyclone's rider would be Tom<br>Three Persons. Three Persons was a Blood Indian from Southern Alberta. When Three<br>Persons got on Cyclone, the horse would rear up, then plunge its head down to throw the<br>rider. Cyclone acted as though it would topple over backwards, but Three Persons hung<br>on. Then it hurled itself forward with its head almost touching the ground. After a wild<br>ride of several minutes, Cyclone began to tire. The judges declared Tom Three Persons<br>the winner of the bucking bronco event. Three Persons was the only Canadian to win a<br>major event at that first Calgary Stampede in 1912.<br>Today, the Calgary Stampede continues to be the largest rodeo and Wild West show in<br>North America. It has many new events and attractions and still attracts the best rodeo<br>riders from all over North America.<br>",

        Content:
          "The history of the Americas, from their discovery by Columbus till the founding of<br>modern nation states, has been the struggle among European powers for the largest and<br>richest sections of the continents. In particular, England and France have struggled for<br>control of most of North America. Many tragedies and disasters have marked this conflict,<br>but few have been as heart-rendering as the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755.<br>@x@Acadia@x@ refers to what are now the Maritime Provinces of Canada - New Brunswick,<br>Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. In 1605, a French expedition under De Monts and<br>Champlain established an agricultural settlement at Port-Royal in present day Nova<br>Scotia. Although Port-Royal and other colonies had very mixed success, there was a<br>gradual increase of French settlement through the seventeenth century. By 1710, the<br>French, or Acadian, population had reached 2,100.<br>In 1710, Port-Royal fell to the English, and the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 confirmed British<br>ownership of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. By this treaty, the Acadians, that is the<br>French-speaking inhabitants, were allowed to stay or leave the country as they pleased.<br>The majority of inhabitants of Acadia were French and were still being influenced by<br>agents from France and Quebec. This made their loyalty to Britain very doubtful in time<br>of war. Governor Philipps attempted to get the Acadians to swear an oath of allegiance to<br>King George of England. And Philipps was able in 1729 to get the French settlers to<br>agree to a modified oath, with the understanding that they would not have to fight<br>against the French and their Indian allies.<br>The Acadians remained neutral during the fighting between Britain and France in 1744-45<br>in Nova Scotia. In 1749, the British established a new capital for Nova Scotia at Halifax,<br>and began to bring in English-speaking settlers. Because of threats from the French and<br>Indians, most of these settlers remained close to Halifax.<br>British skirmishes with the French and Indians continued, and a new war between France<br>and England was approaching. Governor Lawrence decided that it was time to settle the<br>Acadian question. He ordered the Acadians either to take an unqualified oath of<br>allegiance to England, or to face expulsion from the colony. At that time, in 1755, there<br>were troops and ships from New England in the area, and it seemed like an opportune<br>time to round up the Acadians and ship them out.<br>When the Acadians refused to take the oath which might oblige them to fight against<br>France, the British rounded up about 6,000 of the 8,000 Acadians, burned their homes,<br>and shipped them away to the British colonies of Virginia, the Carolinas, and as far as<br>the mouth of the Mississippi River. Several of the transport ships sank, drowning all on<br>board, and the Acadians died from disease and hardship.<br>Since the expulsion order did not come from London, it has been suggested that<br>Governor Lawrence had personal reasons for the expulsion. He may have been greedy<br>for the land and possessions confiscated from the Acadians. Others say that there was<br>the genuine fear for the English position in North America, and that Lawrence was only<br>protecting the interests of the colony.<br>Acadians still live in Maritime Canada today. Almost 2,000 fled into the woods and eluded<br>the round-up. Another 2,000 Acadians later returned from exile to take the oath of<br>allegiance.<br>Many stories were told of their sufferings. One tale relates how on the very day of his<br>wedding, a bridegroom was seized by the British and transported from the colony. His<br>bride wandered for many years through the American colonies trying to find him. At last,<br>when she was old, she found him on his deathbed. The shock of finding him, and his<br>death, soon caused her death. This is the story of Henry W. Longfellow's poem<br>@x@Evangeline.@x@<br>",

          "Southern Florida stretches south, dividing the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico.<br>Stretching further south is the Florida Keys. These coral islands are the southernmost<br>part of the United States.<br>Since much of southern Florida is close to sea level, it is very swampy. The famous<br>Everglades are wetlands where tall grass and bunches of trees grow. Part of these<br>swamps has been drained for agricultural land. The soil is rich and market gardening is<br>an important activity.<br>The Everglades that remain are too wet to be used for farming. The Everglades are a<br>@x@river of grass.@x@ The deeper water areas stay wet all year, but the shallower pools dry up<br>in the dry season. Some of the water has been drained off for agricultural purposes,<br>making the Everglades drier. Nonetheless, the best way to travel in this region is by<br>airboats. These high boats can go through water and sail over clumps of grass.<br>Besides the wet grasslands, southern Florida has smaller areas of tropical forest. These<br>areas of hardwood trees are called hammocks, and they are rich in animal and plant life.<br>Along much of the coast are mangrove trees, which provide important nesting grounds<br>for wild birds.<br>The Florida Keys stretch 200 miles from Miami southwest. These islands are tropical in<br>climate. Fishing and tourism are important industries.<br>Because of its sub-tropical nature, the animal and plant life of southern Florida differs<br>from other parts of U.S.A. Characteristic animals are alligators and crocodiles. Alligators<br>prefer fresh water and usually live inland, while crocodiles live in salt water along the<br>coats. Both animals are considered dangerous. Alligator wrestling is considered a sport<br>for the brave or foolhardy.<br>Probably Florida is most famous for its birds. At one time, many species were almost<br>extinct. Their long feathers were used on women's hats. Now the law protects them.<br>Florida has at least six species of herons, several egrets, wood storks, white ibises and<br>cormorants. Characteristic Florida birds are the purple gallinule, the anhinga, the limpkin,<br>flamingoes and roseate spoonbills. Many of these birds are notable for their size,<br>colouring and interesting habits.<br>Notable animals include the key deer, a miniature form of the white-tailed deer. There are<br>also panthers or cougars, bobcats, marsh rabbits, mangrove squirrels, round-tailed<br>muskrats and the manatee.<br>Naturally, the Everglades are home to many reptiles. Snakes are common-- both water<br>snakes and land species. There are four poisonous varieties. Both land and sea turtles<br>abound and lizards are fairly common.<br>Fishing is a major industry. Sports fishermen go to sea in search of trophies, such as<br>marlin, sailfish and tarpon. Smaller fish are caught commercially. Fresh water sport fish<br>include bass and gar.<br>After many decades of work to protect the animals and plants of the Everglades, the<br>region finally became a National Park in 1947. It is the third largest park in the U.S.A. and<br>covers one and a half million acres. Within the park live 300 kinds of birds, 30 kinds of<br>mammals, 65 kinds of reptiles and amphibians, and nearly 1,000 species of flowering<br>plants. Of course, it is a major tourist attraction.<br>",

        Content:
          "The Great Wall of China is famous in North America, and many tourists would like to<br>travel there. However, most North Americans don't know very much about Chinese<br>history. That is changing now, as China is becoming an important subject for study in the<br>West.<br>The settled communities of China were targets for nomadic raids since earliest times. For<br>much of its early history, China was not fully unified. However, Shih Huang, who died in<br>210 B.C., united the whole country. Then he set about defending China from the northern<br>nomads. It seems likely that there had been defensive walls in the north before. However,<br>Shih Huang had a wall constructed across the entire north of China. This defensive wall<br>extended for almost 2,000 miles and had 25,000 towers. Such walls were very expensive<br>to build. They also required huge numbers of men to construct them, and later to defend<br>them.<br>Even so, the Great Wall did not stop nomadic invasions altogether. Not long after Shih<br>Huang's death, a tribe called the Huns crossed the wall. The Emperor Hu Ti, who<br>expanded Chinese power beyond the Wall, defeated them.<br>Centuries later, the Mongols to the north of China were united under Genghis Khan. The<br>Mongols attacked China, and Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis, became the first non-<br>Chinese emperor of China in 1279. Eventually, the Chinese rebelled and overthrew their<br>Mongol rulers. Nonetheless, the Mongols remained a threat. In 1449, they destroyed a<br>Chinese army and captured the Emperor.<br>A new Great Wall was begun to keep the Mongols out. This is the wall which tourists visit<br>today and which is pictured on Chinese stamps. Construction continued for 200 years.<br>While some parts were built of packed earth, much of the wall was built of stone, brick<br>and rubble. This is why it took so long. Stones had to be quarried, and bricks baked and<br>carried to the site. Labourers, peasants, soldiers and criminals were forced to work on<br>the wall. Large and small forts and watchtowers carefully guarded the wall. Nearly a<br>million soldiers were stationed along it.<br>The Chinese defenders lit fires when the enemy was sighted. Plumes of smoke and<br>cannon shots told that the enemy was advancing and how many there were. By 1644, the<br>new wall was almost completed.<br>That same year, however, an internal uprising overthrew the Emperor. This revolt was<br>partly caused by the high taxes demanded to pay for the wall. The Emperor's men invited<br>the nomadic Manchu tribe to come through the gates in the wall to help put down the<br>revolt. The Manchus came; but they stayed, and ruled China for several hundred years.<br>Since the Manchus ruled both north and south of the wall, they did not care about<br>maintaining it. Many parts fell into disrepair, and some completely disappeared. Today<br>the parts that remain are a major tourist attraction. The Great Wall of China is one of the<br>wonders of the world. Even if it didn't really succeed in its purpose of keeping the<br>northern nomads out of China.<br>",

          "The first working computers in the 1950s and 1960s were large mainframe machines. In<br>some ways, they were like large calculating machines. The U.S. government, the military<br>and businesses and institutions used them for specific tasks. For example, they might be<br>used to handle the payroll.<br>As more uses were found for computers, the need to transfer data from one computer to<br>another became a concern. In 1969, the U.S. government sponsored a program to explore<br>ways for computers to transfer data over telephone lines. The first Internet was created<br>with four computers linked together.<br>Of course, computer use increased beyond anyone's expectations. Standards were<br>developed that describe how data was to be transferred between computers. A common<br>language for commands and communications emerged. Operating programs such as<br>MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh and Windows came into existence.<br>The Internet quickly expanded beyond government and military uses. The PC became the<br>standard form of computer. Private agencies acted as hosts for Internet usage. Around<br>1982, there were 213 hosts; by 1986, there were 2,300; today, there are millions.<br>The role of computers expanded so quickly that the U.S.S.R., which had discouraged<br>computer use, found itself left behind by the U.S.A. Part of the reason for the collapse of<br>the Soviet Union in 1989 was that they had fallen too far behind the United States in high<br>tech areas to ever catch up.<br>One of the most popular uses of the computer is electronic mail, or e-mail. You can send<br>a letter by computer over the Internet to anywhere in the world in seconds or less. And it<br>doesn't cost anything extra. Now data can be transferred great distances almost<br>instantaneously.<br>Another major Internet use is the World Wide Web. In the early days, all web pages were<br>text only. In the 1990s, it became possible to make web pages interactive and multi-media.<br>Interactive means that readers could click on items on the web page and get more<br>information. They could also communicate directly with the web-page owner. Multi-media<br>means that web pages were no longer text only. They could also have graphics,<br>film/video, and audio. This has helped to turn computers into popular entertainment.<br>Nowadays, people spend hours every day surfing the net. However, there are some<br>problems. For some people, computers are addictive. Many businesses are trying to<br>control employees using the net during working hours. Since the Internet includes just<br>about every kind of information, not all of it is good. You can find directions on how to be<br>a criminal or a terrorist. There are scam artists who want to cheat you out of your money.<br>There are also aggressive, pornography salesmen, not to mention people who want to<br>kill your computer with viruses.<br>Since the Internet is not closely regulated, it is up to individual users to follow computer<br>etiquette. Parents need to supervise their children's use of the net. Although the Internet<br>has some disadvantages, many people see the net as one of the greatest inventions of<br>modern times.<br>",

Besides its natural beauty, people study the<br>night sky for many reasons. Some believe that they can read the future in the stars.<br>Others think that the stars influence the weather, while some people worship the stars<br>and the planets.<br>There is a problem with stargazing. If the night is cloudy, people on the ground cannot<br>see the stars, also bad weather makes being outside at night uncomfortable. Besides, not<br>everybody wants to stay up late at night.<br>A planetarium is an ideal solution to all these problems. A planetarium is usually a large<br>dome-covered building. It has seating like a theatre. The program here is a star show. A<br>special projector throws a picture of the night sky on the ceiling of the planetarium<br>theatre. Like a movie projector, the planetarium projector can show a constantly<br>changing program. It can show how the stars look right now, how they looked thousands<br>of years ago, and how they will look in the future.<br>Planetariums can be both entertaining and educational. School children can go to learn<br>about the nine planets of the solar system, or about the various groupings of stars.<br>Planetariums can teach you how to find the stars and planets yourself when you are out<br>at night. There can also be dramatic showings about changes to the universe over time.<br>This is also a way to view special phenomena, like Halley's Comet, which only appears<br>once in a lifetime.<br>Planetariums can also show how ancient people viewed the skies. Shepherds, living out<br>under the sky, imagined that groups of stars represented wonderful people and huge<br>animals. Stories were told about these constellations. Sometimes, the story explained<br>how the people or animals became stars. For example, why Orion, the mighty hunter, is<br>chasing Taurus the Bull. Planetariums can project these figures on their screen.<br>They can also speed up changes in the heavens. It takes about 28 days for the moon to<br>travel through all its phases. Changes in the moon, or in the sun, can be shown easily.<br>Planetariums can also show the sky the way it appears in another part of the world. Or<br>the way it appeared on a famous historical occasion.<br>Special heavenly phenomena, such as a meteor shower, can also be demonstrated.<br>Things that appear only rarely in the real sky can be shown every night. A planetarium is<br>usually concerned to put in special programs to keep its audience coming back. Since<br>the heavens are always moving and changing, there is no shortage of ideas for<br>programmers.<br>",

        Content:
          "The Victorian period was a time of many new inventions. Earlier discoveries, such as the<br>steam engine, the screw propeller, the power of electricity, and the possibility of sending<br>messages along a wire, were now applied to everyday life. Inventors such as Thomas<br>Edison and Nicholas Tesla explored new methods for harnessing electric power. Some of<br>the greatest discoveries were made by Alexander Graham Bell.<br>Bell was born in Scotland in 1847. Both his father and grandfather taught speech<br>methods and worked with deaf and dumb children. Alexander was also interested in this<br>work, especially as his mother was almost deaf. Alexander's two brothers died of<br>tuberculosis, and he himself contracted the disease, so his parents decided to leave<br>Scotland for a drier, healthier climate. They moved to Brantford, Ontario, Canada, and<br>lived in a roomy, comfortable house overlooking the Grand River. Today, the Bell<br>Homestead is an historical museum that attracts visitors from all over the world.<br>At that time, Canada did not have a lot of business opportunities, so Alexander found a<br>job teaching speech in Boston, U.S.A. But he returned to Brantford every summer. In<br>Boston, Bell married one of his deaf students. His father-in-law suggested that there<br>were good business opportunities in inventing communication devices. Bell soon<br>developed a method for sending more than one telegraph message at the same time.<br>While working on improving the telegraph, Bell and his assistant, Thomas Watson, found<br>a way to send the human voice over wires. On August 10, 1876, Bell sent the first<br>telephone message over wires strung between Brantford and Paris, Ontario - eight miles<br>away. The telephone caused an international sensation, with government leaders asking<br>to have one. But Bell didn't stop there. He worked on the recording properties of wax<br>cylinders and other approaches to flat phonograph records. He also developed the<br>photophone, which later led to the development of the motion picture sound track.<br>Bell worked on these inventions at his laboratory in Washington, D.C., but he didn't like<br>the hot humid summer weather there. So Bell began looking for a new place to spend his<br>summers. He decided to build a summer home in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The<br>Island reminded Bell of his native Scotland.<br>Now he had space during the summer to do experiments outside. He soon began to<br>experiment with flying machines. Bell designed and tested huge kites, hoping to come up<br>with a frame for a flying machine. Along with some enthusiastic friends, Bell also<br>experimented with airplanes. On February 23, 1909, one of these planes flew through the<br>air for half a mile. This was the first airplane flight in the British Empire. The Alexander<br>Graham Bell Museum at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, displays many of these inventions.<br>Bell was also interested in making a faster boat. Since much of a boat stays under water,<br>the water resistance slows the boat down. Bell thought that if you could raise the boat<br>out of the water it would go much faster. Working on Cape Breton Island, Bell and his<br>friends developed the hydrofoil, a boat that would skim the surface of the water at high<br>speeds. Hydrofoils are in use in many places today.<br>Every time people use the telephone, listen to a recording, watch a movie or television,<br>or ride on a hydrofoil, they owe a debt to that great inventor, Alexander Graham Bell.<br>",

          "War, persecution, and economic depression affect not only adults, but also old people,<br>children, babies, the sick and the handicapped. Since history is written mostly about<br>politicians, soldiers, intellectuals and criminals, we don't read very often about how<br>events affect ordinary people. Now and then a special book will shed light on what it was<br>like to live in the midst of terrible events. Such a book is @x@The Diary of Anne Frank.@x@<br>Anne Frank was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1929. Her father Otto Frank was<br>a businessman who moved the family to the Netherlands in 1934. In Amsterdam, Otto<br>started a company selling pectin to make jams and jellies. Later he began a second<br>company that sold herbs for seasoning meat.<br>Otto Frank had decided to leave Germany because of the policies and personality of the<br>new German Chancellor Adolph Hitler. Hitler had a personal hatred not only for Jewish<br>people but also for everything Jewish. He felt that one way to strengthen Germany and<br>solve its problems was to kill or drive out all the Jews. Hitler also felt that other groups,<br>such as blacks, gypsies, the handicapped, homosexuals and the chronically unemployed<br>should be eliminated. Then only strong healthy @x@true Germans@x@ would be left.<br>Since Hitler had a plan to solve Germany's economic problems, he received a lot of<br>popular support. Very few Germans realized that he was mentally and emotionally<br>unbalanced and would kill anyone who got in his way.<br>The Frank family was Jewish, and they felt that they would be safe in the Netherlands.<br>However, in May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands and soon took over the<br>government. In 1941, laws were passed to keep Jews separate from other Dutch citizens.<br>The following year, Dutch Jews began to be shipped to concentration camps in Germany<br>and Poland. Just before this began, Anne Frank, Otto's younger daughter, received a<br>diary for her 13th birthday. Less than a month later, the whole family went into hiding.<br>Otto Frank had made friends with the Dutch people who worked with him in his business<br>operations. Now these friends were ready to help him, even though hiding Jews from the<br>authorities was treated as a serious crime.<br>Behind Otto Frank's business offices, there was another house that was not visible from<br>the street. Here the Franks moved many of their things. Only a few trusted people knew<br>they were living there. The Franks moved into these small rooms on July 6, 1942, and<br>they lived there with another Jewish family, the Van Pels, until the police captured them<br>on August 4, 1944. So, for more than two years, the two families never went outside. All<br>their food and supplies had to be brought to them.<br>During this period, Anne Frank told her diary all her thoughts and fears. Like any teenage<br>girl, she hoped that good things would happen to her, that she would become a writer or<br>a movie star. She complained that her parents treated her like a child. She insisted that<br>she was grown up.<br>She also talked about how difficult it was to live in a small area with seven other people<br>and not be able to go outside. She wrote about the war and hoped that the Netherlands<br>would soon be liberated from the Germans. Anne sometimes envied her older sister,<br>Margot, who was so much more mature, and who never got into trouble. She and Margot<br>wrote letters to each other to pass the time. Anne even had a romance with Peter van<br>Pels, who was seventeen.<br>Then all their fears came true. All the eight Jews hiding in the house were arrested and<br>eventually sent to the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. Although the war was ending, it<br>did not end soon enough for the Frank family. Only Otto Frank survived the war.<br>One of their helpers, Miep Gies, saved Anne's diary and kept it. After the war, Otto Frank<br>decided to publish it. Since 1947 more than 20 million copies have been sold in 55<br>languages. Anne's diary shows the terrible cost of hatred, persecution and war better<br>than any history book.<br>",

          "Many years ago, a German opera impresario was asked why so many of his leading<br>ladies were physically unattractive. He replied, @x@The ones who look like horses, sing like<br>nightingales, and vice versa.@x@ Certainly, a good voice doesn't always go with an attractive<br>appearance. But in our day of media images, good looks seem very important.<br>Charlotte Church recorded her first album when she was 12 years old. It was called,<br>@x@Voice of an Angel.@x@ Everyone agreed that the little girl has a very big voice. And they<br>were delighted that Charlotte not only sounded like an angel, she also looked like one.<br>Her sweet schoolgirl appearance and winning smile are part of her success.<br>Charlotte Church was born in Cardiff, Wales in February, 1986. Music and singing are<br>very important in Welsh culture, and all of Charlotte's family were musical. Although<br>Wales is part of Great Britain, the Welsh people are very proud of their own language,<br>history and heritage. Now that Wales has its own parliament at Cardiff, Welsh culture is<br>promoted even more strongly. Charlotte sings some of her songs in the Welsh language.<br>Charlotte began singing along with the radio as an infant, and by the age of three she<br>could sing a number of popular songs. She began singing lessons when she was nine.<br>Charlotte first appeared on television early in 1997. This led to a number of other TV and<br>concert appearances. In 1998, she signed a contract with Sony to record five albums.<br>Since Charlotte's first album appeared, she has spent a lot of time doing promotional<br>tours. Since she is a schoolgirl, her two tutors travel along with her. @x@Voice of an Angel@x@<br>was recorded in five days in Cardiff, Wales. All the songs were ones that Charlotte<br>already knew and liked. These included @x@Pie Jesus,@x@ @x@The Lord's Prayer,@x@ @x@Jerusalem,@x@<br>and @x@Danny Boy.@x@ The album came out on November 9, 1998, and within a couple of<br>weeks was number four on the popular music charts. She recorded her second album,<br>@x@Charlotte Church,@x@ in 1999.<br>Travelling involves doing @x@showcases@x@ for people in the music industry and the media.<br>This is to encourage people to promote your music. Charlotte also appeared on various<br>U.S. talk shows, including David Letterman and Jay Leno. She finds that she gets asked<br>the same questions over and over again.<br>Besides media celebrities, Charlotte has met many leading public figures. Since she is<br>Roman Catholic, Charlotte was especially excited to meet the Pope. This was after she<br>had been invited to sing at a Christmas concert at the Vatican. She was also asked to<br>sing at Prince Charles' fiftieth birthday party in 1998. She saw the Prince again in 1999,<br>when she sang at the official opening of the Welsh National Assembly. Queen Elizabeth<br>and Prince Philip talked to her too. Later that year, she sang for Bill and Hilary Clinton at<br>the Ford Theatre in Washington.<br>Something that people like about Charlotte Church is that she hasn't been spoiled by<br>fame. Many show business kids are loud, brash, noisy and rude. But when she is away<br>from the stage, the young singer leads a normal life with her family and friends. Even<br>when she is on TV, she comes across as an ordinary teenager, but a very nice one.<br>Charlotte's voice always gets comments. It seems like such a big voice for a little girl.<br>Very few teenagers have a powerful operatic voice like hers. Some people have found it<br>hard to believe that it is actually Charlotte singing.<br>For the most part, she enjoys her success. She likes to travel and meet new people. Los<br>Angeles is her favourite city, and she likes the United States and Canada. But she is<br>always glad to get home to Wales and be with her friends. At the moment, she goes to an<br>all-girl school, so she doesn't see boys very often. But, at age fifteen, an interest in boys<br>is likely to become a factor in her life.<br>Charlotte now has recorded three albums, and we can expect a fourth in 2001. She has<br>also written an account of her life for all her fans. It is entitled, @x@Voice of an Angel: My<br>Life (So Far).@x@<br>",

        Title: "Christmas Holidays",
        Content:
          "In many ways, Christmas is the most important holiday in North America. It is the most<br>important commercial festival. Most retail stores do half of their annual business in the<br>six weeks or so before Christmas. Christmas is an important holiday from work and<br>school. Many workers take the whole week off between Christmas and New Year's Day. It<br>is the biggest time of the year for parties, gift-giving, home decorations and visiting.<br>Many homeowners compete to see who can have the best display of lights. It is also an<br>important time for the entertainment industry. Many Christmas movies, TV shows,<br>recordings, concerts and plays are produced every year for the Christmas season. It is<br>also the time of year when the largest number of people attend church, because<br>Christmas is a religious festival too. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.<br>How all these different things came together to become Christmas is a long story. Why,<br>for example, is Jesus' birthday celebrated on December 25th? No one knows the exact<br>day that Jesus was born. But, Jesus was born during the Roman Empire and, for the<br>Romans, December 25th was a very important day.<br>The Romans had many gods and many religions. Two religions, both of which had one<br>main god, were the worship of the Invincible Sun and of Mithras. These gods were both<br>honoured on December 25th. Because December 25th was just after the shortest day of<br>the year, it was a natural time to worship the sun.<br>December was also a time to celebrate the end of the agriculture year. The Romans held<br>one of their main festivals, the Saturnalia, beginning on December 17th. It lasted for a<br>week. The Romans also began the custom of celebrating New Year's Day on January 1st.<br>So the last half of December and the beginning of January was a wonderful time for<br>partying and games.<br>The early Christians didn't know what day Jesus was born. At first, they celebrated his<br>birthday on January 6th. However, as most of the people in the Roman Empire were<br>becoming Christians, it was decided to move the date to December 25th. The celebration<br>lasted twelve days until January 6th, and took the place of all other festivals. That way,<br>people who were used to celebrating on December 25th would feel more comfortable.<br>As different peoples became Christian, they brought their own customs to be part of<br>Christmas. The people of northern Europe used evergreen trees and mistletoe as<br>symbols of spring and eternal life. The evergreen tree became the Christmas tree. The<br>mistletoe is hung from the ceiling at Christmas for couples to kiss under it. It was also in<br>northern Europe where the idea of Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, began.<br>In Roman times, there was a man who became known as Saint Nicholas. He is said to<br>have given gifts to the poor and provided dowries for poor girls who wouldn't otherwise<br>be able to marry. The idea of the gift-giving Saint became joined with the northern idea of<br>Spirit of Christmas festivities.<br>It was a poem written in 1831 by the American writer, Clement Moore, which popularized<br>Santa Claus throughout the world. @x@Twas the night before Christmas...@x@ told the story of<br>how Santa visits every house in the world on Christmas Eve and brings toys for good<br>girls and boys. Since that time, parents have secretly bought toys for their children at<br>Christmas. When the children awake on Christmas Day, they find toys by the chimney, or<br>under the Christmas tree. They are told that Santa Claus and his reindeer brought them.<br>Adults also give gifts to each other at Christmas time. No wonder that the stores sell so<br>many things then! It is often said that Christmas is becoming too commercialized. In the<br>rush to get everything ready--to buy the gifts, decorate the house and tree, give parties,<br>visit family and friends, and attend special Christmas events--the original reason for<br>celebrating is sometimes forgotten. Only when people go to church, or sing Christmas<br>carols, or attend musical performances about Jesus' birth, do they remember that<br>Christmas is the birthday of Christ.<br>",

        Title: "Garage Sales and Yard Sales",
        Content:
          "Every Saturday morning in our part of the world - except in winter - many people drive<br>around the city looking for yard sales. Yard sales, or garage sales, often take place in the<br>driveway of someone's home, or perhaps on the front lawn. The homeowners take out all<br>the stuff they don't want and arrange it in front of their house. Usually, they put a price<br>tag on items. People driving by will stop to see if there is anything they want.<br>Many people spend every Saturday morning shopping at yard sales. If they find that they<br>have bought too many things, then they have a yard sale of their own.<br>Some of the shoppers are dealers who buy things for resale. Sometimes they resell them<br>at their own yard sales. But some dealers are professionals who run antique stores, used<br>bookshops, flea markets or used furniture and appliance stores. Usually the dealers will<br>try to get to the yard sale before anyone else. That way they have the best selection.<br>Often they will try to buy items for less than the price tag says. The cheaper they can buy<br>the item, the more profit they can make when they resell it. Their motto is, @x@Buy low. Sell<br>high.@x@<br>Sometimes a merchant will boast that he paid one dollar for a glass or china cup at a<br>yard sale, and sold it for $100 at his store, or on the Internet. By having catalogues that<br>show the value of @x@collectibles,@x@ dealers can sometimes make large profits. Now,<br>however, many of the people having yard sales will try to check the value of the things<br>they are selling first. So it is getting harder to get a real bargain.<br>One reason for yard sales is that North Americans often live in big houses, which fill up<br>with things. People may use the basement, the attic, the spare room and the garage to<br>store things that they are not using. If they store things in their garage, all they have to<br>do is open the garage door to have a garage sale. When children grow up and move away,<br>the parents will often sell the children's old clothes, toys and furniture.<br>Another reason for yard sales is that there are a lot of things that people might like, but<br>don't want to pay full price for. For example, if someone likes to read novels, they may be<br>happy to pay one dollar for a book at a yard sale, rather than 20 or 30 dollars at a retail<br>store.<br>What sorts of things are sold at yard sales? Just about anything that you might find in a<br>house or a yard. There are ornaments, china, home decorations, sports equipment,<br>bicycles, games, dolls, toys, tables and chairs, lamps, appliances, books, records,<br>paintings, clothes, record players, and much more. Some items are things that were<br>popular a few years ago but have now gone out of fashion. This might include many toys,<br>books and games that relate to an old television show that is no longer being shown.<br>While a lot of older people go to yard sales, so do a lot of students. Students and young<br>people may need cheap furniture for their apartment or a bicycle to get to school or work.<br>They may not be able to pay full price. If you are lucky, you can find almost anything at a<br>yard sale. The trick is to get there early. Most yard sales are advertised to start at 9:00 am,<br>but dealers may arrive as early as 7:30 am. By 10:00 am the busiest part is already over,<br>although most yard sales go on into the afternoon. Yard sales tend to prove the common<br>saying that @x@one person's trash is another person's treasure.@x@<br>",

        Title: "Helen Keller",
        Content:
          "What would it be like to be unable to see anything, hear anything, or say anything? Life<br>for young Helen Keller was like that. She had had an illness before she was two years old<br>that had left her deaf, dumb and blind. After that, it was difficult for her to communicate<br>with anyone. She could only learn by feeling with her hands. This was very frustrating for<br>Helen, her mother and her father.<br>Helen Keller grew up in Alabama, U.S.A., during the 1880s and 1890s. At that time, people<br>who had lost the use of their eyes, ears and mouth often ended up in charitable<br>institutions. Such a place would provide them with basic food and shelter until they died.<br>Or they could go out on the streets with a beggar's bowl and ask strangers for money.<br>Since Helen's parents were not poor, she did not have to do either of these things. But<br>her parents knew that they would have to do something to help her.<br>One day, when she was six years old, Helen became frustrated that her mother was<br>spending so much time with the new baby. Unable to express her anger, Helen tipped<br>over the baby's crib, nearly injuring the baby. Her parents were horrified and decided to<br>take the last chance open to them. They would try to find someone to teach Helen to<br>communicate.<br>A new school in Boston claimed to be able to teach children like Helen. The Kellers wrote<br>a letter to the school in Boston asking for help. In March 1887, a teacher, twenty year old<br>Anne Sullivan arrived at the Keller's home in Tuscumbia, Alabama.<br>Anne Sullivan herself had had a very difficult life. Her mother had died when she was<br>eight. Two years later, their father had abandoned Anne and her little brother Jimmy.<br>Anne was nearly blind and her brother had a diseased hip. No one wanted the two<br>handicapped children, so they were sent to a charitable institution. Jimmy died there. At<br>age 14, Anne, who was not quite blind, was sent to the school for the blind in Boston.<br>Since she had not had any schooling before, she had to start in Grade One. Then she had<br>an operation that gave her back some of her eyesight. Since Anne knew what it was like<br>to be blind, she was a sympathetic teacher.<br>Before Anne could teach Helen anything, she had to get her attention. Because Helen<br>was so hard to communicate with, she was often left alone to do as she pleased. A few<br>days after she arrived, Anne insisted that Helen learn to sit down at the table and eat<br>breakfast properly. Anne told the Kellers to leave, and she spent all morning in the<br>breakfast room with Helen. Finally, after a difficult struggle she got the little girl to sit at<br>the table and use a knife and fork.<br>Since the Keller family did not like to be strict with Helen, Anne decided that she needed<br>to be alone with her for a while. There was a little cottage away from the big house. The<br>teacher and pupil moved there for some weeks. It was here that Anne taught Helen the<br>manual alphabet. This was a system of sign language. But since Helen couldn't see,<br>Anne had to make the signs in her hands so that she could feel them. For a long time,<br>Helen had no idea what the words she was learning meant. She learned words like @x@box@x@<br>and @x@cat,@x@ but hadn't learned that they referred to those objects. One day, Anne dragged<br>Helen to a water pump and made the signs for @x@water@x@ while she pumped water over<br>Helen's hands. Helen at last made the connection between the signs and the thing.<br>@x@Water@x@ was that cool, wet liquid stuff. Once Helen realized that the manual alphabet<br>could be used to name things, she ran around naming everything. Before too long, she<br>began to make sentences using the manual alphabet. She also learned to read and write<br>using the @x@Square Hand Alphabet@x@ which was made up of raised square letters. Before<br>long, she was also using Braille and beginning to read books.<br>Helen eventually learned to speak a little, although this was hard for her because she<br>couldn't hear herself. She went on to school and then to Radcliffe College. She wrote<br>articles and books, gave lectures, and worked tirelessly to help the blind. The little girl<br>who couldn't communicate with anyone became, in time, a wonderful communicator.<br>",

        Title: "Trial By Jury",
        Content:
          "If you are a citizen of Canada or the United States, it is very likely that you will be<br>summoned at some time for jury duty. A letter will come in the mail, telling you to report<br>to a certain place at a given time. There are legal penalties for not attending, because jury<br>duty is considered every citizen's responsibility. Often a large number of people, perhaps<br>several hundred, will be summoned at one time.<br>When you arrive, you will join a line-up of others who are registering for duty. Eventually,<br>you will get to a table and talk to an official. If you have a special reason for not being a<br>juror, such as ill health, you may be excused at this point. Those not immediately<br>exempted become a part of a @x@jury panel.@x@ Out of this panel, a number of juries of twelve<br>people will be chosen. These will decide a variety of criminal cases over the next few<br>weeks.<br>What follows is the experience of one woman in a @x@jury pool.@x@ She went with the others<br>into a large courtroom where they spent the whole day. At the front of the courtroom<br>were the judge, and the lawyers for the prosecution and for the defence. One of the<br>lawyers explained what the case was going to be about. The names of the jury panel<br>were in a box at the front. When someone's name was called, they went up to the front of<br>the courtroom.<br>The person called up would then have a chance to explain why they couldn't serve as a<br>juror, if there was some reason preventing them. For example, one woman was<br>dismissed because she knew the accused. The first jury to be chosen was for a burglary<br>case. A panel member went forward and faced the accused. Then the lawyers in the trial<br>decided whether the juror was satisfactory to them. At lunchtime, the panel was<br>dismissed for an hour.<br>The second jury was to try someone on a charge of murder. Usually the panel was told<br>approximately how long the trial might be. Since jurors are not usually paid, many would<br>like to avoid being involved in a long trial. The woman was called forward and had to look<br>the man accused of murder in the eye. This made her quite nervous. Judging by her<br>expression, the two lawyers would decide whether they wanted her on the jury or not.<br>The defence lawyer would try to choose someone who seemed sympathetic to the man<br>accused. The prosecutor would prefer someone who was not sympathetic. The woman<br>excused herself by saying that she had a very young child to look after and no relatives<br>to help. She was allowed to go home at the end of the day.<br>Some people wonder whether it is fair for lawyers to dismiss jurors who may not be<br>sympathetic to their cases. For example, defence lawyers may try to choose young<br>people if they think that these will be less severe to their clients. In the case above, the<br>lawyer seemed to prefer women to men. This means that a lot of people are dismissed<br>from being jurors without a good reason.<br>One principle of the jury system, however, is to protect the rights of the accused<br>particularly well. One might say that the jury system is biased in favour of the defendant.<br>This is why defence lawyers have an opportunity to dismiss people who they think will<br>not be favourable to their clients.<br>Furthermore, having twelve jurors gives the defence a good opportunity for a successful<br>defence. If the defence attorney can raise a reasonable doubt about the guilt of his client<br>in even one juror, then the accused has a chance of being released. This happened in the<br>O.J. Simpson murder trial. There, even though there was strong evidence that Simpson<br>committed the crime, the defence was able to insinuate some doubts among the jurors.<br>Moreover, the defence lawyers may be able to appeal to the emotions of the jurors,<br>particularly if they can think of a way to gain sympathy for their client.<br>For this reason, defence lawyers are more likely to choose trial by jury over trial by judge<br>alone. A judge is less likely to be swayed by emotion than a jury. And a defence attorney<br>may also prefer a criminal trial to a civil suit. In the latter case, the client does not have to<br>be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but will be found liable if the preponderance<br>of evidence is against him or her. This is why O.J. Simpson was acquitted on criminal<br>charges, but then found liable for damages in a civil suit.<br>",

        Content:
          "It is good to have a favorite place where you can go to be alone and relax. Sometimes,<br>this spot is your own room or a quiet part of the house. Sometimes, it is somewhere<br>outdoors away from people and busy streets. Or you may feel most comfortable in a<br>shopping mall or a downtown park.<br>Our favorite place is especially nice to go to at times of stress. When work gets too<br>hectic, or we have trouble with other people, then our favorite place is a refuge from<br>these difficulties.<br>My special spot is very close to where I work. It is on a busy university campus. At one<br>end of the university, hidden among several buildings, there is a pond. This pond is<br>surrounded by large rocks, which rise up like a small cliff on one side. Shooting out of<br>these rocks are water pipes, which create a small waterfall. The water is drawn up from<br>the bottom of the pond and drops back into the middle. This keeps the water from<br>becoming stagnant.<br>On the other side of the pond, there is a grassy shore and a flat stone patio. Here, in the<br>summer, people can sit out and have meals. Yet, very few people come here to sit;<br>perhaps because they are very busy with their work.<br>There is something very calm and pleasant about trees and grass and shade, about birds<br>singing and water rippling, and flowers blooming all around. Green is a relaxing color for<br>the eyes. Still water suggests peace. Running water seems full of life.<br>There is a large weeping willow tree on the grassy side of the pond. Its branches touch<br>the water and shade much of the pond. Rushes grow in the shallow water. The pond is<br>only about three feet deep. In the summer, there are beautiful water lilies in bloom over<br>much of the pond. Sometimes, I have counted over thirty blooms, and some flowers are<br>over five inches wide.<br>Goldfish and minnows are the pond's chief inhabitants. But there are also crawfish and<br>other animals. At different times there have been a turtle, a water snake, and a family of<br>ducks.<br>Behind the pond is a large glassy wall, which reflects the entire scene. One can also go<br>inside and view the pond, even on rainy or snowy days.<br>There are several gardens close to the pond. One of the gardeners told me that he could<br>turn the waterfall off and on. Usually on the weekends it is turned off, but if there is a<br>special event the waterfall is left on.<br>Behind the glassy wall is a cafeteria. Here, visitors to the university are sometimes taken<br>for meals. The students do not use it.<br>In the winter, the pond freezes over. Sometimes, if the winter is very cold the pond<br>freezes right down to the bottom. Then, most of the goldfish and minnows die. Usually,<br>some survive in the mud at the bottom of the pond. Occasionally, people will skate on the<br>pond, if the ice is smooth.<br>When spring comes, a lot of the old rushes and water lily leaves from the previous year<br>are cleared away. This makes the pond more attractive and gives the new plants room to<br>grow. If there are too many rushes, they are sometimes cut down in summer. Then<br>visitors can see the water lilies better.<br>Chances are that if you ever visit Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, you will<br>hear about Pond Inlet. And, if you come in the summer, you will probably see me there,<br>thinking about my next article.<br>",

          "What do business and ethics have to do with each other? Business is about making<br>profits. Ethics is about right and wrong. How are they connected? Well, business ethics<br>is the study of right and wrong as applied to business actions.<br>Some businessmen would say that there is no need for business ethics. If we don't break<br>the laws of the country, we have nothing to worry about. However, we can do many bad<br>things without breaking laws. In some countries, it would be legal for a businessman to<br>pollute the land, sea and air, to confine his workers to barracks and to hire children to<br>work in factories. But, these things may not be right. On the other hand, it may be illegal<br>for a businessman to do some good things. For example, his society may expect him to<br>treat people unequally and discriminate against some ethnic or religious groups.<br>In order to know what is right or wrong, we need a moral rule. This rule does not come<br>from business itself, but from ethics. So we need a statement of what we believe to be<br>right. The American Declaration of Independence in 1776 states an ethical principle: @x@We<br>hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal….@x@ The Declaration<br>further tells us that all men have a right to @x@…life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.@x@<br>Principles such as these can be used in American politics and law to decide whether an<br>action is right or wrong.<br>Many companies have their own ethical guidelines. IBM, for example, outlines its<br>corporate ethics under headings such as, @x@Tips, Gifts and Entertainment,@x@ @x@Accurate<br>Reporting,@x@ @x@Fair Competition,@x@ and @x@Not boasting.@x@ So each employee knows what to do<br>or not to do in various situations.<br>Ethical choices are made on three levels. Individuals, by companies and by societies,<br>make them. An individual might choose whether or not to accept a bribe. A company<br>might decide whether or not to bribe government officials. A government or society<br>might decide whether or not to outlaw bribery. Similar principles of right and wrong<br>might be used at all three levels. For example, it might be decided that bribery is simply<br>wrong in all situations. On the other hand, it might be decided to view the situation case<br>by case. In other words, there is a strong ethical stand and a more tentative ethical stand.<br>The strong ethical stand applies when you have a basic moral principle and apply it to all<br>situations. For example, you might believe that it was always wrong to let workers handle<br>hazardous substances without any protection. The weaker stand would consider whether<br>it is legal to do so. If it is legal to let workers handle dangerous materials, and this<br>conforms to social expectations, then the weak ethical stand would say, @x@No problem.@x@<br>As long as the law is not broken, and no one strenuously objects, then everything is okay.<br>However, in ethics there is a principle called the @x@moral minimum.@x@ This principle means<br>that you should never harm another person knowingly. The only exception would be to<br>protect some other people, or yourself. So business ethics would say that the<br>businessman who exposes his workers to hazardous chemicals is wrong. He is not<br>practicing the moral minimum.<br>",

        Title: "Colonial Williamsburg",
        Content:
          "Travelers in the desert or the jungle sometimes see the remains of old cities. These cities<br>were once large and prosperous, but something has changed. Perhaps the climate got<br>drier or wetter; perhaps the trade routes, which had brought merchants to the city, now<br>went elsewhere; perhaps enemies destroyed them; or perhaps disease or famine drove<br>the people away.<br>Other cities, which were once important, have become less so in time. Jamestown,<br>Virginia, the first English colony in America is now only an historic site. It began as the<br>capital of Virginia. But when fire destroyed the government buildings in 1699, the capital<br>was moved to nearby Williamsburg.<br>Williamsburg was an important town for many years. The British Governors lived there,<br>and two of them worked on the plans for the town and its buildings. The College of<br>William and Mary was established there in the 1690s - the second oldest college in<br>America. As the capital, Williamsburg contained many public buildings, including a<br>courthouse, a jail, a powder magazine, the governor's palace, and the government<br>building. Of course, there were many private houses as well.<br>From 1699 until 1780, Williamsburg was the capital of Virginia. Many people came there<br>for government and legal business. It was also a social center with dances, fairs, horse<br>races and auctions. The Governor and his wife provided expensive dinners and<br>entertainment for their guests.<br>Most of the important people in Virginia owned tobacco plantations. In 1612, John Rolfe<br>had first raised tobacco to sell to England. Soon tobacco farming was Virginia's most<br>important business. Most planters were able to build large houses and buy slaves to do<br>their work. One plantation owner is said to have owned 300,000 acres of land and 1,000<br>black slaves, as well as having large amounts of money.<br>The planters were the leaders of this colonial society, and they resented British<br>interference in their local government. When England imposed taxes on the American<br>colonists in 1765, it was a Virginian, Patrick Henry, who spoke against them. His words,<br>@x@Give me liberty, or give me death@x@ helped to inspire the American Revolution. As<br>complaints about British rule increased, it was Virginians who led the rebels. George<br>Washington became commander of the revolutionary army, and Thomas Jefferson<br>drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<br>In 1780, the capital of Virginia was moved to Richmond. Williamsburg was now simply a<br>small college town of local importance. Not much changed in Williamsburg for many<br>years. In the twentieth century, the Reverend Dr. Goodwin, who was the priest at the<br>Williamsburg Church, had the idea of restoring Williamsburg to the way it appeared in<br>colonial days. Goodwin approached John D. Rockefeller Jr. with his idea, and Rockefeller<br>agreed to finance the project. Beginning in 1926, the old buildings of Williamsburg were<br>restored to their original form. First were the college buildings, then the Raleigh Tavern,<br>the government building, the governor's palace and so on. Buildings that had been<br>destroyed over time were reconstructed from plans and descriptions.<br>Soon the restored buildings were opened to the public. Guides, dressed in eighteenth<br>century costumes, show visitors through the buildings and gardens. Visitors can also<br>travel to nearby tobacco plantations. Now tourists who pay admission to visit this<br>wonderful historic town finance much of the work of restoration and conservation.<br>",

        Title: "Physics: Newton’s Laws of Motion and Universal Gravitation",
        Content:
          "Some of the most important ideas in physics are the laws of motion and of universal gravitation.<br>These laws were discovered during the 1660s by Isaac Newton, an English mathematician and<br>physicist. The three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation provided a crucial starting<br>point for later discoveries in theoretical physics.<br>Let us first consider Newton's three laws of motion. The first law of motion states that every object in a uniform state of motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. This law is also known as the law of inertia. Newton's first law means that objects tend to maintain their current velocity: objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to stay in motion.<br>This law seems to contradict common sense, because the objects we see tend to slow down unless<br>a force is applied to them; however, this deceleration is due to the force of friction that is caused by<br>the air, the water, or the ground. If we could study objects moving in a vacuum, those objects would<br>not slow down at all. The second law of motion explains the relation between the force applied to an object, the mass of an object, and the acceleration of an object. According to Newton's second law, the force required to cause a given amount of acceleration of an object of a given mass can be calculated by multiplying the acceleration of the object by the mass of the object. In other words, the force, F, equals the mass, m, times the acceleration, a. It is easy to see how this law works. If you want to cause a heavy car to increase or decrease its speed very suddenly, you must apply a very strong force. If you want to cause a lighter car to increase or decrease its speed quite gradually, you need to apply much less force. The third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. One of the important applications of this idea can be seen in the flight of rockets. When a rocket expels hot, expanding gases from its tail, the backward force of those gases propels the rocket forward. Newton realized that the second law of motion could help to explain why objects, such as apples in an apple tree, tend to fall to the earth, and why the moon is held in orbit around the earth. Newton discovered the law of universal gravitation, which can be summarized as follows: every object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them. This law has many important implications for our understanding of the world around us. One of these involves the tides: we can understand the rising and falling of ocean levels by considering the gravitational forces applied by the moon and the sun. Newton's laws have served as the foundation for physics and engineering since the 17th century. In the next article, we will discuss the revolutionary discoveries made by physicists during the 20th century.<br>",

        Title: "Physics: Quantum Theory and Relativity",
        Content:
          "During the early decades of the 20th century, the field of theoretical physics was revolutionized by some startling new discoveries. These discoveries-quantum theory and relativity-had profound implications for our understanding of the universe and for the development of new technology.<br>Quantum theory is concerned with the absorption and emission of energy by matter, and with the wavelike motion of matter. This area of physics was developed by several scientists over a period of about thirty years, beginning at the start of the 20th century. Before the development of quantum theory, physicists had believed that energy could be absorbed or emitted in any amount, and that matter occupied a definite location in space.<br>However, quantum theory showed that these conceptions were inaccurate.<br>According to quantum theory, energy can only be absorbed or emitted in certain, discrete amounts, which are called quanta. It is as if energy is transported in small @x@packets@x@ that only exist in particular sizes. This finding can be seen in the frequencies of light and other radiation that are emitted by different kinds of atoms. Each atom only emits radiation having certain frequencies. These frequencies correspond to the amounts of energy that are released when the electrons that orbit around the nucleus of an atom move from a higher orbital path to a lower orbital path.<br>Another astonishing feature of quantum theory is that matter can exist both as a particle and as a wave. Experiments have shown that the electrons of an atom can behave as waves; for example, electrons can diffract, or bend, in the same way that light waves bend. One surprising implication of this wavelike property is that the precise location of a particle cannot be known with certainty.<br>The other major discovery of the early 20th century physics was the theory of relativity.<br>Unlike quantum theory, relativity was largely the work of one man, a physicist named Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the motion of the observer. Einstein showed that, contrary to the assumptions of classical physics, time and motion are not constant, but relative to the observer. If a spaceship could move at an extremely high speed, time would pass considerably more slowly on that spaceship than for people who stayed on the earth. Moreover, the spaceship will appear to become shorter as its speed increases, and the mass of the spaceship would increase as its speed increased.<br>One of the bewildering ideas from Einstein's theory of relativity is the notion that time can be added to the three dimensions of space-length, width, and height-as a fourth dimension. According to the theory of relativity, massive objects cause a distortion, or warping, of this four-dimensional space-time continuum.<br>But because the speed of light is constant, light will follow a straight line through space-time, and its motion will appear to be warped as it moves through space that is distorted by massive objects such as stars or planets.<br>Another astonishing implication of the theory of relativity is that matter and energy are interchangeable.<br>This is the basis for Einstein's famous formula, E = mc2, which states that energy equals mass times<br>the speed of light squared. This idea is the basis for atomic energy, which allows for the release of<br>energy by destroying a small amount of matter when the nucleus of an atom is divided, or split.<br>Today, thanks to the efforts of Einstein and the other physicists of the early 20th century, the study of  theoretical physics is based largely on the ideas of quantum theory and relativity. Also, much of our modern technology-from electronics to nuclear power-is based on the ideas that were developed during this exciting period in the history of science.<br>",

        Title: "The Periodic Table of the Elements",
        Content:
          "Every chemistry student is familiar with the periodic table of the elements. This famous chart arranges the elements-that is, the different varieties of atoms-according to their atomic weights. One of the useful features of this table is that it identifies groups of elements that have similar chemical properties.<br>The idea of arranging elements within a periodic table was proposed in 1869 by a Russian chemist named Dimitri Mendeleyev. For many years, chemists had understood that matter consisted of many different kinds of basic particles called atoms, and that these basic elements could combine into many different compounds.<br>But even though much information had been learned about these elements, scientists did not yet understand how the many different properties of the elements were related to each other, and they could not predict what kinds of elements would be discovered in the future.<br>Mendeleyev realized that the elements could be arranged meaningfully in terms of their atomic weight. For example, hydrogen is the element with the lightest atomic weight, so hydrogen is given the atomic number one. The element with the next-lightest atomic weight is helium, so helium is given the atomic number two. When Mendeleyev arranged the elements in this way, he discovered that elements located close together usually had different properties, but that elements with similar properties could be found at regular intervals further along the table.<br>This discovery of the @x@periodic@x@ repetition of the properties of elements allowed Mendeleyev to predict the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered. Based on the atomic number of a hypothetical element, Mendeleyev could predict its properties, and later discoveries showed that Mendeleyev's predictions were largely correct.<br>The periodic table has allowed the identification of several important groups of elements, which are discussed briefly below.<br>The alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, are soft metals that readily conduct heat and electricity. They can explode when exposed to water. The halogens, such as fluorine and chlorine, are non-metallic elements that combine with metallic elements to form salts.<br>The transition metals, such as mercury and gold, are very numerous. They conduct heat and electricity, and can be shaped and stretched. They are often found in compounds with oxygen. Three of the transition metals (iron, cobalt, and nickel) can produce a magnetic field.<br>The noble gases, such as helium and neon, have also been called @x@inert@x@ gases, because they do not<br>readily form compounds with other elements.<br>The non-metals, such as oxygen and carbon, do not conduct heat or electricity very well, and cannot be easily stretched or shaped. Non-metals are the main elements in organic compounds.<br>",

        Title: "Heredity and Mendel’s Experiments",
        Content:
          "For thousands of years, people have understood that many characteristics of plants or animals are transmitted from parent to offspring. Because of this understanding, farmers have been able to create better varieties of crops and livestock, by allowing the reproduction of only those individuals that have the desired characteristics.<br>As a result, we now have domestic plants and animals that provide us with much more food than their wild ancestors ever did. But even though people have long possessed some vague appreciation for the principles of heredity, it has only been since the late 19th century that a systematic understanding of those principles has been gained. The first scientist to discover the laws of heredity was an Austrian monk, Johann Gregor Mendel. Mendel's investigations of heredity made use of the pea plant. He studied several characteristics of peas that are transmitted by heredity, such as the color of the peas (green versus yellow), the texture of the peas<br>(smooth versus wrinkled), and the height of the plant (tall versus short). Mendel studied heredity by first finding plants that had shown the same characteristic for several generations?that is, plants that were @x@pure-bred@x@ for certain traits. He then crossed, or hybridized, pairs of pea plants that had different colors, different textures, and different heights.  Mendel found that the offspring of these crossings did not show characteristics intermediate between those of the parents, but instead resembled only one of the parents, with respect to a particular characteristic.<br>For example, when yellow pea plants and green pea plants were crossed, all of the offspring had yellow peas.<br>In this sense, the yellow color is said to be dominant, and the green color is said to be recessive.<br>Mendel also found that the recessive characteristics could re-emerge in later generations. When he crossed different hybridized plants, he found that one-quarter of these second-generation offspring would show the recessive trait, such as the green color.<br>From these results, Mendel deduced that traits are transmitted by discrete particles. (Nowadays, these are called @x@genes@x@.) For a given characteristic, an offspring inherits two of these, one from each parent. If the offspring inherits different genes from each parent, then one of the genes is @x@dominant@x@ over the other, and the dominant trait emerges in the offspring. However, the recessive trait may emerge in a later generation.<br>Mendel also found that different characteristics are inherited independently. For example, the inheritance of color (green versus yellow) did not depend on the inheritance of texture (smooth versus wrinkled). Each characteristic, such as color or texture, was inherited separately, without influence due to any other characteristic. As a result, any combination of color and texture could occur. Mendel's work was published in 1866, but it was ignored by other scientists until about 1900, when other scientists independently re-discovered Mendel's findings, and brought attention to his work.<br>When scientists began studying heredity more widely, they noticed many cases that were exceptions<br>to Mendel's rules. For example, there are cases in which two or more different kinds of characteristics tend to be inherited together. Nevertheless, Mendel's basic principles provided the first insight into the mechanisms of heredity, and his work is recognized as the beginning of the scientific study of genetics.<br>",

        Title: "Photosynthesis",
        Content:
          "Did you know that plants can @x@eat@x@ light? Green plants obtain their energy directly from the sun, by<br>converting light energy into chemical energy. This process is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis provides life not only to plants, but also to the animals (including people) that eat those plants. In addition, photosynthesis gives us the oxygen that we need to breathe.<br>Scientists have gained detailed knowledge of the complex process of photosynthesis, which will be<br>summarized only briefly here. The basic chemical reaction of photosynthesis involves the conversion of water, carbon dioxide, and light energy into glucose and oxygen. Glucose is a form of carbohydrate that allows the storage of energy. It takes six molecules of carbon dioxide and twelve molecules of water to produce one molecule of glucose, with six molecules of water and six molecules of oxygen as by-products. How do plants obtain the water, carbon dioxide, and light energy that they need for photosynthesis to occur -Water is obtained through the roots of the plant, and is transported upwards through the stem or trunk of the plant to the leaves. The leaves can directly absorb carbon dioxide from the air. The leaves also contain a green-colored chemical, which is a pigment named chlorophyll. Chlorophyll has the special ability to absorb light energy from the sun, and convert that energy into chemical form.<br>The process of photosynthesis involves several steps. In the first stages, light energy is absorbed by<br>chlorophyll. Some of this energy is used to decompose water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.<br>The hydrogen is used in the next steps of photosynthesis, and the oxygen is released into the air as<br>a by-product. The remaining energy that is gained from sunlight is stored in chemical compounds<br>that are also used in the next stages of photosynthesis.<br>In those later stages, the hydrogen from the earlier stages is used, along with carbon and oxygen from carbon dioxide molecules, to create increasingly more complex molecules. This process uses the stored energy from the earlier stages of photosynthesis. Because this energy has already been obtained from sunlight, these later stages of photosynthesis do not require any additional light.<br>The later stages of photosynthesis eventually produce glucose, which is a complex carbohydrate molecule. Glucose allows energy to be stored in a stable form that can be used by the plant. Glucose molecules can be sent throughout the plant, to provide the energy that is needed for the plant to live, grow, and reproduce.<br>If the plant is eaten by an animal, then the animal can use this energy for its own life processes.<br>The process by which plants convert light into food is surely one of the miracles of nature. Photosynthesis is a fascinating and complex process, and it provides us with the food we eat and the air we breathe.<br>",

Today, scientists have determined the approximate sequence in which life forms have appeared, evolved, and disappeared here on our planet.<br>The age of the earth has been estimated at about 4.5 billion years, based on a technique called radiometric dating. This technique is based on the fact that certain radioactive elements slowly decay into other elements.<br>By measuring the ratios of the different kinds of elements in rocks, scientists can estimate the age of those rocks. According to these tests, the earth (and moon) are about 4.5 billion years old.<br>Some forms of life emerged very early in the history of the earth. Fossils of some organisms similar to blue-green algae have been dated as being more than three billion years old. For billions of years, however, the earth had only very simple, single-celled forms of life. During this period, there were not yet any complex organisms made up of many cells.<br>About 570 million years ago, there was a sudden expansion and diversification of multi-cellular organisms. During the next 325 million years, many varieties of plants and animals evolved. Most life forms existed in the seas, and many kinds of fish emerged during this time.

        Content:
          "If you have ever visited a zoo, you have probably noticed that people seem to be fascinated by the<br>great apes. This fascination is probably due to the similarity that people notice between themselves<br>and these intelligent animals. In fact, humans share more similarities with the great apes than with<br>any other living creatures.<br>The various species of great apes (including people) belong to the Primate order, along with lesser<br>apes, monkeys, lemurs, and other small primates. The great apes possess several important features<br>in common. For example, they all have well-developed eyes, and their brains can process complex<br>visual information. In contrast, the sense of smell is not so well developed among apes. The great apes do not have tails, but apes do have an opposable thumb, which allows them to grasp objects easily.<br>Great apes are also able to walk upright, at least for short distances. They tend to be partly arboreal,<br>or tree-dwelling, and partly terrestrial, or ground-dwelling. Great apes usually have only one offspring at a time, and these offspring require a long period of intense parental care before adulthood is reached.<br>Finally, the great apes are capable of more advanced reasoning and learning than any other animals. In this article, we will discuss four different kinds of great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Most zoologists would also include humans as a fifth kind of great ape; in fact, chimpanzees and bonobos have greater genetic similarity to humans than to orangutans and gorillas!<br>Orangutans have orange-brown fur, and live in the jungles of Indonesia. Male orangutans, which weigh up to 90 kilograms, are much larger than females, which weigh up to 45 kilograms. Orangutans like to eat fruit, and they tend to be solitary, living alone or in very small groups. Orangutans are rather distantly related to the other great apes.<br>Gorillas, which live in the jungles of equatorial Africa, are the largest and strongest of the great apes. Male gorillas can weigh over 250 kilograms, and females over 100 kilograms. Gorillas generally eat leaves and small plants. They live in large social groups consisting of a dominant male, several adult females and juveniles, and sometimes a subordinate male. Although gorillas can make fierce, threatening displays, they are generally much less violent than chimpanzees.<br>Chimpanzees also live in the equatorial regions of Africa. These great apes tend to be somewhat smaller in size than humans, but chimpanzees are very strong. The diet of chimpanzees mainly includes fruit and other vegetation, but they also eat insects and even small mammals. Unlike gorillas, chimpanzees usually live in large social groups, often containing dozens of individuals. Chimpanzee sexual behavior tends to<br>be rather promiscuous. Relations between different groups of chimpanzees tend to be violent, with deadly fighting over territory. Bonobos are closely related to chimpanzees, and for many years the bonobo was considered to be simply a variety of chimpanzee. However, bonobos are different from chimpanzees in several ways. First, bonobos<br>tend to be less violent, with only rare aggressive encounters between groups. Second, female bonobos form strong alliances with each other, and as a result they are more powerful than male bonobos. Finally, bonobos are highly promiscuous in their sexual behavior, with sex apparently being used as a means of establishing friendships.<br>The diversity of the behavior and social structures of the great apes is truly remarkable. It is very interesting to learn about these animals, which in many ways remind us of ourselves.<br>",

        Content:
          "As a child, you might have wondered what you would find if you could dig a hole deep into the center of the earth. Scientists have also been interested in this question, and during the 20th century they were able to learn much information about the composition of the earth. However, they did not gain this knowledge by digging a hole deep into the center of the earth, because this is an impossible task. Scientists have inferred the composition of the earth by using several sources of information.<br>First, they have carefully recorded and measured the @x@seismic waves@x@ that are released by earthquakes. Second, they have observed the composition of meteorites that have fallen to the earth's surface from outer space. Third, they have conducted laboratory experiments to determine the density<br>of the earth and of different kinds of rocks. Let us now consider the structure of the earth itself.<br>The earth is composed of three distinct layers, known as the crust, the mantle, and the core.<br>The top layer is the crust, which is like a thin shell around the earth. The crust is composed of<br>different kinds of rocks. Under the oceans and deep below the continents, the crust is made up<br>of dense rocks, such as basalt, but the crust of the continents themselves is made up of lighter<br>rocks, such as granite. The crust is only a few kilometres thick under the oceans, but can be<br>30 to 90 kilometres thick under the continents.<br>Below the crust, the composition of the earth changes sharply at the point where the next layer,<br>the mantle, begins. This large layer is almost 3000 kilometres thick, and it makes up about two-thirds of the earth's mass. The mantle consists of rocky materials such as silicon dioxide, magnesium oxide, and iron oxide. Even though temperatures are very high in the mantle, the rock is under such high pressure that it is unable to melt. However, the upper part of the mantle is almost in liquid form.<br>Beneath the mantle, the core of the earth extends right to the very center of our planet, nearly<br>6400 kilometres below the surface. The core is itself divided into two parts: the outer part is liquid,<br>and the inner part is solid. Scientists know that the core is at least partly liquid, because earthquake<br>waves, which cannot travel through liquid, are stopped by the earth's core. The earth's core is very<br>dense, being composed of iron and nickel. These metals are responsible for the earth's magnetic field.<br>Of course, the crust, mantle, and core make up the solid parts of the earth, but we should not forget<br>about the water and air that rest on top of the earth's surface. About 71% of the earth's surface is<br>covered by water. A very small part of this water is the fresh water of lakes and rivers, but nearly all<br>of this water is the salt water of the seas and oceans. In every 100 kilograms of sea water, there are<br>about 3.5 kilograms of salt. More than three-quarters of this salt is common table salt, or sodium<br>chloride, but there are also large amounts of magnesium chloride and other salts.<br>Above both the oceans and the continents is the earth's atmosphere. The air around us is made<br>up mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 20%), with smaller amounts of argon, water<br>vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases. The atmosphere is thickest at the earth's surface, and<br>becomes thinner at higher altitudes. Ten kilometres above sea level, the air pressure is only about<br>one-fifth of what is found at sea level itself. At these high altitudes, the air becomes very cold, with<br>temperatures more than fifty degrees below zero. Above these altitudes is found the ozone layer,<br>where ozone molecules, each consisting of three oxygen atoms, protect the earth from the sun's<br>ultraviolet radiation.<br>Thanks to the work of many scientists, we have now learned a great deal about the composition of<br>the earth. But much more knowledge about our planet remains to be learned by future scientists!<br>",

        Content:
          "Ever since early humans first became aware of their environments, they have recognized the importance of the sun's heat and light to life on the earth. People around the world have worshipped the sun as a god, and more recently the sun has been the subject of intense study by scientists.<br>The sun is actually a star, and is described by astronomers as a rather @x@average@x@ star. But the sun is<br>much closer to the earth than any other star. The sun's average distance from the earth is only 150 million kilometres. Although this distance is obviously very great, other stars are much farther away. At the sun's relatively close distance, light can reach the earth in about eight minutes. The next nearest stars to the earth, however, are so far away that their light takes four years to reach the earth! Given these unimaginably vast distances, it is easy to understand why the sun seems so much brighter than any other star.<br>The sun is much larger than the earth or the moon. In fact, the sun's diameter is about 110 times that of the earth, and about 400 times that of the moon. This might seem surprising, given that the sun and moon appear to be of virtually equal size when we look at them in the sky. However, the sun is about 400 times farther away from us than the moon is, and this explains why the sun and moon appear to be the same size.<br>This fact is a remarkable coincidence, and it makes possible the occurrence of spectacular solar eclipses, when the moon seems to cover the sun almost perfectly. Note that even though the sun is a fascinating object of study, you should never look at it directly. Even if you are wearing dark sunglasses, the intense radiation from the sun can seriously damage your eyes.<br>The sun is composed of densely-packed gases, mainly hydrogen and helium. At the core of the sun,<br>hydrogen is transformed into helium by the process of nuclear fusion, which releases tremendous energy. Temperatures at the sun¡?s core are estimated to reach 15 million degrees Kelvin; at the surface of the sun, the temperatures are much cooler, reaching only a few thousand degrees. The sun will someday use up all of its hydrogen, causing it to gradually die. But do not worry about this-scientists estimate that the sun will have enough fuel for at least another six billion years!<br>Periodically, there are magnetic storms on the surface of the sun. Astronomers refer to these disturbances as sunspots. The activity of these sunspots sometimes causes interference with radio transmissions here on earth, and is responsible for the @x@northern lights@x@ that are sometimes seen at night in northern latitudes.<br>The activity of sunspots seems to rise and fall in an eleven-year cycle, but there are also some longer periods of high or low sunspot activity. Scientists believe that periods with few sunspots tend to be associated with cooler temperatures on earth.<br>Besides providing us with the light and heat that are needed for the survival of life on earth, the sun also gives us much of the beauty that we see in the world around us. Anyone who has watched the colorful sky at sunrise or sunset will surely agree!<br>",

A war cabinet has been<br>formed of five members, representing, with the Labour, Opposition, and Liberals, the<br>unity of the nation.<br>It was necessary that this should be done in one single day on account of the extreme<br>urgency and rigor of events. Other key positions were filled yesterday. I am submitting a<br>further list to the king tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of principal ministers<br>during tomorrow.<br>The appointment of other ministers usually takes a little longer. I trust when Parliament<br>meets again this part of my task will be completed and that the administration will be<br>complete in all respects.<br>I considered it in the public interest to suggest to the Speaker that the House should be<br>summoned today. At the end of today's proceedings, the adjournment of the House will<br>be proposed until May 21 with provision for earlier meeting if need be. Business for that<br>will be notified to MPs at the earliest opportunity.<br>I now invite the House by a resolution to record its approval of the steps taken and<br>declare its confidence in the new government.

We have before us an ordeal of the most<br>grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering. You ask,<br>what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and<br>with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny<br>never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.<br>You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs-<br>victory in spite of all terrors-victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without<br>victory there is no survival.<br>Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British<br>Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind<br>shall move forward toward his goal.<br>I take up my task in buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to<br>fail among men.<br>I feel entitled at this juncture, at this time, to claim the aid of all and to say, @x@Come then,<br>let us go forward together with our united strength.@x@<br>",

Today, in the world<br>of freedom, the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner.<br>There are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what<br>is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to<br>Berlin. There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them<br>come to Berlin. And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with<br>the Communists. Let them come to Berlin. And there are even a few who say that it is<br>true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Let<br>them come to Berlin.<br>Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to<br>put up a wall to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. I want to say, on<br>behalf of my countrymen, who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic,<br>who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to<br>share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last eighteen years. I know of no<br>town, no city, that has been besieged for eighteen years that still lives with the vitality<br>and the force, and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin. While the<br>wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist<br>system, all the world can see, we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your mayor has<br>said, an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating<br>families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people<br>who wish to be joined together.<br>What is true of this city is true of Germany-real, lasting peace in Europe can never be<br>assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men,<br>and that is to make a free choice. In eighteen years of peace and good faith, this<br>generation of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their<br>families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people. You live in a<br>defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main.<br>So let me ask you, as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes<br>of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of<br>Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace<br>with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.<br>Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.<br>When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as<br>one and this country and this great continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe.<br>When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober<br>satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades.<br>All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man,<br>I take pride in the words Ich bin ein Berliner.<br>",

Kennedy:<br>'Speech after Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.'<br>Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice for his fellow human beings,<br>and he died because of that effort.<br>In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it is perhaps well to ask<br>what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in. For those of you<br>who are black-considering the evidence there evidently is that there were white people<br>who were responsible-you can be filled with bitterness, with hatred, and a desire for<br>revenge. We can move in that direction as a country, in great polarization-black people<br>amongst black, white people amongst white, filled with hatred toward one another.<br>Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend,<br>and to replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land,<br>with an effort to understand with compassion and love.<br>For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at<br>the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I can only say that I feel in my own<br>heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a<br>white man. But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an effort<br>to understand, to go beyond these rather difficult times.<br>My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He wrote, @x@In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls<br>drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom<br>through the awful grace of God.@x@<br>What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is<br>not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness but love and<br>wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice towards those who<br>still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black.<br>So I shall ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther<br>King, that's true, but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of<br>us love-a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke.<br>We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We've had difficult times in<br>the past. We will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the<br>end of lawlessness; it is not the end of disorder.<br>But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country<br>want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all<br>human beings who abide in our land.<br>Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the<br>savageness of man and to make gentle the life of this world.<br>Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.<br>",

          "We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples joined in battle to reclaim<br>this continent to liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible<br>shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for<br>liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in Normandy<br>the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking<br>unparalleled in human history.<br>We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft,<br>but forty years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men,<br>and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the<br>morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran<br>to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the<br>invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The<br>Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would<br>be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.<br>The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers - at the edge of the cliffs shooting<br>down at them with machine-guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers<br>began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull<br>themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was<br>cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back,<br>and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top,<br>and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the<br>continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting<br>only ninety could still bear arms.<br>Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the<br>top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.<br>These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are<br>the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.<br>Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's poem. You are<br>men who in your lives fought for life...and left the vivid air signed with your honor'...<br>Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You were young the<br>day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys<br>of life before you. Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What<br>impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take<br>these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and<br>somehow we know the answer. It was faith, and belief; it was loyalty and love.<br>The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they<br>fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead<br>or on the next. It was the deep knowledge - and pray God we have not lost it - that there<br>is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of<br>force for conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those<br>others did not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.<br>You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country is worth dying for, and<br>democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of<br>government ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight<br>tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.<br>",

We must keep our old<br>democracy forever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our<br>sights upon a land of new promise.<br>The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we<br>are all created equal. It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation<br>spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.<br>Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this<br>the American Century.<br>And what a century it has been. America became the world's mightiest industrial power;<br>saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again,<br>reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.<br>Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built<br>unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and<br>explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the<br>wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all<br>minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.<br>Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose. We began<br>the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast. We began the<br>20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free<br>enterprise, conservation, and human decency. Those choices made all the difference. At<br>the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the<br>Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people,<br>and, yes, to form a more perfect union.<br>When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does<br>today. We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation.<br>In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge,<br>strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.<br>Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth. Once again, we are building stronger<br>families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.<br>Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are<br>safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.<br>",

We-the American people-we are the solution. Our founders understood<br>that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible<br>enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new<br>day.<br>As times change, so government must change. We need a new government for a new<br>century-humble enough not to try to solve our problems for us, but strong enough to<br>give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives<br>within its means, and does more with less. Yet where it can stand up for our values and<br>interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real<br>difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less. The preeminent<br>mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity-not a guarantee,<br>but a real opportunity-to build better lives.<br>Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders taught us that the<br>preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship. And we<br>need a new sense of responsibility for a new century. There is work to do, work that<br>government alone cannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls;<br>coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets<br>from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others.<br>Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility-not only<br>for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation. Our greatest<br>responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century. For any one of<br>us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.<br>The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future-will we become one nation,<br>one people, with one common destiny, or not? Will we all come together, or come apart?<br>The divide of race has been America's constant curse. And each new wave of immigrants<br>gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of<br>religious or political conviction are no different. These forces have nearly destroyed our<br>nation in the past. They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror. And they<br>torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.<br>These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated,<br>robbing both of what they might become. We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark<br>impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere. We shall overcome them.<br>And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one<br>another.<br>Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st<br>century. Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work<br>together, forge new ties that bind together.<br>",

The promise<br>we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise.<br>In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession. Our schools<br>will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes<br>of every girl and every boy. And the doors of higher education will be open to all. The<br>knowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just of the few, but<br>of every classroom, every library, every child. Parents and children will have time not<br>only to work, but to read and play together. And the plans they make at their kitchen table<br>will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.<br>Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to<br>shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone who can work, will work, with today's<br>permanent under class part of tomorrow's growing middle class. New miracles of<br>medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and<br>hardworking families too long denied.<br>We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against<br>terror and destruction. Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or<br>biological weapons. Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and<br>innovation and ideas. And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of<br>democracies.<br>Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations-a nation that balances<br>its budget, but never loses the balance of its values. A nation where our grandparents<br>have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the<br>reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time. A nation that fortifies the<br>world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our<br>water, air, and majestic land.<br>",

Prosperity and power-yes, they are important, and we<br>must maintain them. But let us never forget: The greatest progress we have made, and<br>the greatest progress we have yet to make, is in the human heart. In the end, all the<br>world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the<br>human spirit.<br>Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at<br>the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation. Like a prophet<br>of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as<br>equals before the law and in the heart. Martin Luther King's dream was the American<br>Dream. His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed. Our<br>history has been built on such dreams and labors. And by our dreams and labors we will<br>redeem the promise of America in the 21st century.<br>To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office. I ask the members of<br>Congress here to join in that pledge. The American people returned to office a President<br>of one party and a Congress of another. Surely, they did not do this to advance the<br>politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore. No, they call on<br>us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with America's mission.<br>America demands and deserves big things from us-and nothing big ever came from<br>being small. Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin, when facing<br>the end of his own life. He said: @x@It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on<br>acrimony and division.@x@<br>Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For all of us are on that<br>same journey of our lives, and our journey, too, will come to an end. But the journey of<br>our America must go on.<br>And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to do. The demands<br>of our time are great and they are different. Let us meet them with faith and courage, with<br>patience and a grateful and happy heart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the<br>noblest chapter in our history. Yes, let us build our bridge. A bridge wide enough and<br>strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise.<br>May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never<br>know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American<br>Dream alive for all her children; with the American promise of a more perfect union a<br>reality for all her people; with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all<br>the world.<br>From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth. May God<br>strengthen our hands for the good work ahead-and always, always bless our America.<br>",

          "President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of<br>authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old<br>traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service<br>to our nation. And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and<br>ended with grace. I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's<br>leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.<br>We have a place, all of us, in a long story-a story we continue, but whose end we will not<br>see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of<br>a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went<br>into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. It is the American<br>story-a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and<br>enduring ideals.<br>The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs,<br>that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born. Americans<br>are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our nation has<br>sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course. Through<br>much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a<br>raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic<br>faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal<br>we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years,<br>we have a long way yet to travel.<br>While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our<br>own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden<br>prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so<br>deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will<br>not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every<br>generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice<br>and opportunity.<br>I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who<br>creates us equal in His image. And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us<br>onward. America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals<br>that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it<br>means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must<br>uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more,<br>not less, American.<br>Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility,<br>courage, compassion and character. America, at its best, matches a commitment to<br>principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will<br>and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness. Some seem to believe that our politics can<br>afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.<br>",

If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and<br>character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy<br>to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.<br>We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the<br>determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this<br>commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment. America, at its best, is<br>also courageous.<br>Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending<br>common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our<br>fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of<br>blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.<br>Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more<br>young lives.<br>We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we<br>have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our<br>economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our<br>defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of<br>mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.<br>The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains<br>engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors<br>freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without<br>arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all<br>nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.<br>America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know<br>that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our<br>views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and<br>abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons,<br>however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.<br>Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are<br>citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.<br>Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights<br>and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.<br>And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a<br>pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their<br>humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws. Many in our<br>country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And I can<br>pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho,<br>we will not pass to the other side.<br>",

But it was not. I am not<br>a political figure. As I said at the time, and I'd like to re-iterate now, my interests are<br>humanitarian. That is why I felt drawn to this human tragedy. This is why I wanted to play<br>down my part in working towards a world-wide ban on these weapons. During my days in<br>Angola, I saw at first hand three aspects of this scourge. In the hospitals of Luanda, the<br>capital, and Huambo, scene of bitter fighting not long ago, I visited some of the mine<br>victims who had survived, and saw their injuries. I am not going to describe them,<br>because in my experience it turns too many people away from the subject. Suffice to say,<br>that when you look at the mangled bodies, some of them children, caught by these mines,<br>you marvel at their survival. What is so cruel about these injuries, is that they are mostly<br>invariably suffered, where medical resources are scarce.<br>I observed for myself some of the obstacles to improving medical care in most of these<br>hospitals. Often there is a chronic shortage of medicine, of pain killers, even of<br>anaesthetics. Surgeons constantly engaged in amputating shattered limbs, never have all<br>the facilities we would expect to see here. So the human pain that has to be borne is<br>often beyond imagining. This emergency medical care, moreover, is only the first step<br>back to a sort of life. For those whose living is the land, loss of an arm or leg, is an<br>overwhelming handicap which lasts for life. I saw the fine work being done by the Red<br>Cross and other agencies to replace lost limbs. But making prostheses is a costly as well<br>as a complicated business. For example; a young child will need several different fittings<br>as it grows older. Sometimes, the severity of the injury makes the fitting of an artificial<br>limb impossible. There are never enough resources to replace all the limbs that are lost.<br>",

That is something<br>to which the world should urgently turn its conscience.<br>In Angola, one in every 334 members of the population is an amputee! Angola has the<br>highest rate of amputees in the world. How can countries which manufacture and trade in<br>these weapons square their conscience with such human devastation?<br>My third main experience was to see what has been done, slowly and perilously, to get<br>these mines out of the earth. In the Kuito and Huambo region I spent a morning with<br>small team from Halo Trust, which is training Angolans to work on the pervasive<br>minefields and supervising their work. I speak of @x@our team@x@ because men of the Mines<br>Advisory group - or, in this instance, the Halo Trust - who volunteer for this hazardous<br>work are usually former members of our own Services. I take this opportunity to pay my<br>tribute to the work these men do on our behalf - the perils they encounter are not just<br>confined to mines.

Whenever such tricky mines appear, the de-miner will call in one of the<br>supervising team, who will then take over. That is what keeps their lives perpetually at<br>risk. It might be less hazardous, I reflected, after my visit to Angola, if some of the<br>technical skills used in making mines had been applied to better methods of removing<br>them. Many of these mines are relatively cheap - they can be bought for 5 apiece, or less.<br>Tracing them, lifting them, and disposing of them, costs far more - sometimes as much<br>as a hundred times more.<br>Angola, is full of refugees returning after a long war.

Or he finds mines on what was once his land, and attempts to clear them.<br>There were many examples of that in Angola. These mines inflict most of their casualties<br>on people who are trying to meet the elementary needs of life. They strike the wife, or the<br>grandmother, gathering firewood for cooking - They ambush the child sent to collect<br>water for the family<br>I was impressed to see the work being done by many of the world's agencies on @x@Mine<br>Awareness.@x@ If children can be taught at school, if adults can be helped to learn what to<br>do, and what not to do in regions that have been mined, then lives can be saved and<br>injuries reduced.<br>",

Angola is probably more heavily mined than<br>anywhere else, because the war went on for such a long time, and it invaded so much of<br>the country. So that country is going to be infested with mines, and will suffer many more<br>victims. And this brings me to one of the main conclusions I reached after this<br>experience.<br>Even if the world decided tomorrow to ban these weapons, this terrible legacy of mines<br>already in the earth would continue to plague the poor nations of the Globe. @x@The evil<br>that men do, lives after them.@x@<br>And so, it seems to me, there rests a certain obligation upon the rest of us.<br>One of my objectives in visiting Angola was to forward the cause of those, like the Red<br>Cross, striving in the name of humanity to secure an international ban on these weapons.<br>Since them, we are glad to see, some real progress has been made. There are signs of a<br>change of heart - at least in some parts of the world. For that we should be cautiously<br>grateful. If an international ban on mines can be secured it means, looking far ahead, that<br>the world may be a safer place for this generation's grandchildren.<br>But for this generation in much of the developing world, there will be no relief, no<br>relaxation The toll of deaths and injuries caused by mines already there, will continue.<br>This tracing and lifting of mines, as I saw in Angola, is a desperately slow business. So in<br>my mind a central question remains. Should we not do more to quicken the de-miners'<br>work, to help the injured back to some sort of life, to further our own contribution to aid<br>and development?<br>The country is enriched by the work done by its overseas agencies and non-<br>governmental organizations who work to help people in Africa and Asia to improve the<br>quality of their lives. Yet mines cast a constant shadow over so much of this work.<br>Resettlement of refugees is made more hazardous. Good land is put out of bounds.<br>Recovery from war is delayed.

We British are as much heirs to the legacy of European<br>culture as any other nation. Our links to the rest of Europe, the continent of Europe, have<br>been the dominant factor in our history. For 300 years we were part of the Roman Empire<br>and our maps still trace the straight lines of the roads the Romans built. Our ancestors -<br>Celts, Saxons and Danes - came from the continent.<br>Our nation was - in that favourite Community word - 'restructured' under Norman and<br>Angevin rule in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.<br>This year we celebrate the three-hundredth anniversary of the Glorious Revolution in<br>which the British crown passed to Prince William of Orange and Queen Mary.<br>Visit the great churches and cathedrals of Britain, read our literature and listen to our<br>language: all bear witness to the cultural riches which we have drawn from Europe - and<br>other Europeans from us.<br>We in Britain are rightly proud of the way in which, since Magna Carta in 1215, we have<br>pioneered and developed representative institutions to stand as bastions of freedom.<br>And proud too of the way in which for centuries Britain was a home for people from the<br>rest of Europe who sought sanctuary from tyranny.<br>But we know that without the European legacy of political ideas we could not have<br>achieved as much as we did. From classical and medieval thought we have borrowed<br>that concept of the rule of law which marks out a civilized society from barbarism. And<br>on that idea of Christendom - for long synonymous with Europe - with its recognition of<br>the unique and spiritual nature of the individual, we still base our belief in personal<br>liberty and other human rights.<br>Too often the history of Europe is described as a series of interminable wars and<br>quarrels. Yet from our perspective today surely what strikes us most is our common<br>experience. For instance, the story of how Europeans explored and colonized and - yes,<br>without apology - civilized much of the world is an extraordinary tale of talent, skill and<br>courage.<br>We British have in a special way contributed to Europe. Over the centuries we have<br>fought to prevent Europe from falling under the dominance of a single power. We have<br>fought and we have died for her freedom. Only miles from here in Belgium lie the bodies<br>of 120,000 British soldiers who died in the First World War. Had it not been for that<br>willingness to fight and to die, Europe would have been united long before now - but not<br>in liberty, not in justice. It was British support to resistance movements throughout the<br>last war that helped to keep alive the flame of liberty in so many countries until the day of<br>liberation.<br>",

The enormous creative and spiritual potential of our<br>nation is not being used sensibly. Entire branches of industry are producing goods<br>which are of no interest to anyone, while we are lacking the things we need. A state<br>which calls itself a workers' state humiliates and exploits workers. Our obsolete economy<br>is wasting the little energy we have available. A country that once could be proud of the<br>educational level of its citizens spends so little on education that it ranks today as<br>seventy-second in the world. We have polluted our soil, our rivers and forests,<br>bequeathed to us by our ancestors, and we have today the most contaminated<br>environment in Europe. Adult people in our country die earlier than in most other<br>European countries...<br>But all this is still not the main problem. The worst thing is that we live in a contaminated<br>moral environment. We fell morally ill because we became used to saying something<br>different from what we thought. We learned not to believe in any thing, to ignore each<br>other, to care only about ourselves. Concepts such as love, friendship, compassion,<br>humility, or forgiveness lost their depth and dimensions, and for many of us they<br>represented only psychological peculiarities, or they resembled gone-astray greetings<br>from ancient times, a little ridiculous in the era of computers and spaceships. Only a few<br>of us were able to cry out loud that the powers that be should not be all-powerful, and<br>that special farms, which produce ecologically pure and top-quality food just for them,<br>should send their produce to schools, children's homes, and hospitals if our agriculture<br>was unable to offer them to all. The previous regime - armed with its arrogant and<br>intolerant ideology - reduced man to a force of production and nature to a tool of<br>production. In this it attacked both their very substance and their mutual relationship.<br>It reduced gifted and autonomous people, skillfully working in their own country, to nuts<br>and bolts of some monstrously huge, noisy, and stinking machine, whose real meaning<br>is not clear to anyone.

I am<br>talking about all of us. We had all become used to the totalitarian system and accepted it<br>as an unchangeable fact and thus helped to perpetuate it. In other words, we are all -<br>though naturally to differing extents - responsible for the operation of the totalitarian<br>machinery; none of us is just its victim: we are all also its co-creators.<br>",

Let us teach ourselves and others that politics<br>can be not only the art of the possible, especially if this means the art of speculation,<br>calculation, intrigue, secret deals, and pragmatic maneuvering, but that it can even be<br>the art of the impossible, namely, the art of improving ourselves and the world...<br>",

          "Today our nation, after eight years under the Tories, is on the brink of utter chaos, facing<br>both social and economic collapse.<br>Our basic industries have been butchered. Our manufacturing base has been eroded<br>with hundreds of businesses, large and small, gone to the wall while the nation has<br>become increasingly dependent on imported goods.<br>The human consequences of this industrial and economic devastation are terrible. Over<br>eight million people struggle for survival on or below the poverty line and four and a half<br>million people are unemployed.<br>Thousands of families are homeless: the number of homeless families in Britain has<br>doubled since 1978, while the enforced repossession of homes is at an all-time record<br>because so many can no longer manage to maintain mortgage payments. Even more<br>people, meanwhile, try to cope as best they can in derelict, often dangerous dwellings -<br>one and a quarter million homes are unfit to live in, while house-building investment<br>throughout Britain has been slashed by sixty per cent since 1979.<br>Sickness and ill health of all kinds are rampant, and they are made even more terrible by<br>the crisis in the National Health Service and throughout the welfare system.<br>The Tories have been utterly ruthless in their butchery of health and welfare provisions.<br>The NHS, once the pride of our nation, has been reduced to a critical condition through<br>hospital closures, medical staff cutbacks, the lack and withdrawal of resources and vital<br>equipment, and the privatization of key services. Approximately 700,000 people wait<br>today for hospital treatment and an increasing number will not receive that treatment<br>before it is too late. Thousands of people who are suffering from serious, often fatal<br>diseases are being turned away through lack of hospital beds and staff.<br>Our social services are faced with ever-increasing family and community problems as<br>Tory attacks take their toll, with children and old people among those most vulnerable.<br>Our education system is also in chaos, as students and teachers struggle against yet<br>more cutbacks, fewer resources - and for our youngsters it must seem often a pointless<br>exercise, with jobs, training and access to higher education becoming more and more<br>difficult to attain.<br>Their teachers meanwhile, like many other trade unionists, have had their negotiating<br>rights removed by the Government, and their commitment to teaching the nation's<br>children treated with contempt.<br>This has become a grim and desperate society - fuelled by unemployment and its social<br>consequences, frustration, rage and despair are rampant all around us. More and more<br>people, I believe, are coming to see themselves as under attack - and they are correct.<br>",

          "We are indeed facing a deliberate political attack by Britain's ruling class. A war of<br>attrition is being waged as capitalism, in a condition of acute crisis, lashes out with<br>increasing ferocity to protect itself. The existence of this crisis is now clear for all to see.<br>It has been exposed by the recent collapse of stock markets throughout the capitalist<br>world, triggered off by the slide on Wall Street (which according to experts is the worst<br>slump since 1929).<br>This collapse will in my view lead inevitably to more hardship for the British people, with<br>a massive increase in unemployment and reduced living standards as capitalism seeks<br>once again to make working people pay for its pursuit of profit and power.<br>The Tories have based their savage policies on an ideology called monetarism - it is this<br>philosophy which has led to the virtual destruction of our manufacturing industries and<br>in particular to the devastation of our coal, rail and steel industries.<br>The steel industry has lost over 150,000 jobs, and the coal and rail industries have lost<br>approximately 100,000 each within a period of eight years. Parts of our nation such as<br>South Wales have been reduced to a lunar landscape as the Tories have systematically<br>butchered our manufacturing and industrial infrastructure...<br>In seeking to win that absolute control which it must have for even limited survival, the<br>State through the Tory Government has introduced twin measures to destroy or render<br>ineffective all those who oppose it. On the one hand, it has deliberately increased<br>unemployment from just over one million to four and a half million in eight years creating<br>as in the 1930s a situation where thirty to forty people pursue each job vacancy, driven<br>by this emotional blackmail to increasing fear.<br>At the same time it has introduced vicious legal measures designed to render the British<br>trade-union movement completely ineffective. Indeed Margaret Thatcher has made it<br>absolutely clear that she wants to wipe socialism off the agenda of British politics; to<br>achieve this aim the Tories are determined also to wipe effective trade unionism off the<br>industrial agenda.<br>Since 1979, we have seen a whole range of anti-trade-union legislation - all of it designed<br>to dismantle the gains achieved by trade unionists in more than a century of struggle.<br>Today, the extent of this legislation is such that Britain's trade-union movement must<br>now be regarded as one of the most oppressed in the world!<br>Tory legislation has removed trade-union immunity, made secondary action including<br>secondary picketing and mass picketing illegal, and rendered all trade unions vulnerable<br>to legal actions which could result in their bankruptcy. Britain's trade unions have found<br>themselves no longer free to determine their own policies in relation to industrial<br>solidarity action.<br>",

If this new Tory<br>legislation is left unchallenged, then civil liberties and human rights in Britain are in<br>danger of being wiped out...<br>As life in Britain becomes harder, as frustrations and tensions rise, the State must bring<br>into play all the elements of its machinery in order to suppress any attempts to throw off<br>its power.<br>The police are used increasingly in paramilitary fashion. The judiciary use greater<br>ruthlessness against any trade union that attempts to stand by its rules and constitution<br>as the experience of the National Union of Mineworkers over the past four years proves.<br>The courts have dealt just as savagely with the Lambeth and Liverpool councillors who<br>refused to betray the commitments made to their communities.<br>Meanwhile the media, now quite openly under the control of international capitalists such<br>as Murdoch and Maxwell, become even more blatantly the mouthpiece of Tory<br>philosophy. The British capitalist press can make no claim to either objectivity or<br>integrity, whether through the gutter journalism of the tabloids, or the more restrained<br>style of the so-called 'quality' papers; they both play a key role in the daily dissemination<br>of lies and misinformation to the public.<br>This is but an outline of the situation which today faces the British Labour and trade-<br>union movement. The terrible irony about it is that whilst throughout our movement there<br>is general agreement on the ravages of the Tory attack - and agreement that it should be<br>stopped - we have not united in an effective force to combat those ravages and challenge<br>the system which has forced them on to our class.<br>On the contrary! Rather than uniting to fight our common enemy, our movement has<br>been diverted time and time again by internal attacks: attacks aimed, disgracefully, at the<br>very sections which have fought so bravely to carry out Labour Party and TUC policies<br>by battling to save jobs, industries, communities and services.<br>Margaret Thatcher has been absolutely clear in recognizing her enemy - it is socialism<br>and she has openly declared her intention of wiping it off the British agenda.<br>",

Understandably proud of this preeminence, we yet realize<br>that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material<br>progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of<br>world peace and human betterment.<br>A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be<br>mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk<br>his own destruction.<br>Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my<br>predecessors in peacetime-or, indeed, by the fighting men of World War II or Korea. Until<br>the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American<br>makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But we can<br>no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.<br>We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.<br>Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the<br>defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net<br>income of all United States corporations.<br>Now, this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is<br>new in the American experience. The total influence-economic, political, even spiritual-is<br>felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We recognize<br>the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave<br>implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure<br>of our society.<br>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted<br>influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.

Only an alert and knowledgeable<br>citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of<br>defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper<br>together.<br>Akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military<br>posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades. In this revolution<br>research has become central. It also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A<br>steadily increasing share is conducted for by, or at the direction of the federal<br>government.<br>Today the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces<br>of scientists, in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university,<br>historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a<br>revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a<br>government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.<br>For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.<br>Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into<br>society's future, we-you and I, and our government-must avoid the impulse to live only<br>for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of<br>tomorrow.<br>We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss<br>also of their political and spiritual heritage.

          "At last people are beginning to see that it is possible, and important in human terms, to<br>respect old buildings, street plans and traditional scales and at the same time not to feel<br>guilty about a preference for facades, ornaments and soft materials. At last, after<br>witnessing the wholesale destruction of Georgian and Victorian housing in most of our<br>cities, people have begun to realize that it is possible to restore old buildings and, what<br>is more, that there are architects willing to undertake such projects.<br>For far too long, it seems to me, some planners and architects have consistently ignored<br>the feelings and wishes of the mass of ordinary people in this country. Perhaps, when<br>you think about if, it is hardly surprising as architects tend to have been trained to<br>design buildings from scratch - to tear down and rebuild ... A large number of us have<br>developed a feeling that architects tend to design houses for the approval of fellow<br>architects and critics, not for the tenants.<br>To be concerned about the way people live, about the environment they inhabit and the<br>kind of community that is created by that environment should surely be one of the prime<br>requirements of a really good architect. It has been most encouraging to see the<br>development of community architecture as a natural reaction to the policy of decanting<br>people to new towns and overspill estates where the extended family patterns of support<br>were destroyed and the community life was lost. Now, moreover, we are seeing the<br>gradual expansion of housing cooperatives, particularly in the inner-city areas of<br>Liverpool, where the tenants are able to work with an architect of their own who listens to<br>their comments and their ideas and tries to design the kind of environment they want,<br>rather than the kind which tends to be imposed upon them without any degree of choice...<br>What I believe is important about community architecture is that it has shown ordinary<br>people that their views are worth having; that architects and planners do not necessarily<br>have the monopoly of knowing best about taste, style and planning; that they need not<br>be made to feel guilty or ignorant if their natural preference is for the more traditional<br>designs - for a small garden, for courtyards, arches and porches - and that there is a<br>growing number of architects prepared to listen and to offer imaginative ideas...<br>",

          "It would be a tragedy if the character and skyline of our capital city were to be further<br>ruined and St Paul's dwarfed by yet another giant glass stump, better suited to<br>downtown Chicago than the City of London. It is hard to imagine that London before the<br>last war must have had one of the most beautiful skylines of any great city, if those who<br>recall it are to be believed. Those who do, say that the affinity between buildings and the<br>earth, in spite of the city's immense size, was so close and organic that the houses<br>looked almost as though they had grown out of the earth and had not been imposed<br>upon it - grown, moreover, in such a way that as few trees as possible were thrust out of<br>the way. Those who knew it then and loved it, as so many British love Venice without<br>concrete stumps and glass towers, and those who can imagine what it was like, must<br>associate with the sentiments in one of Aldous Huxley's earliest and most successful<br>novels. Antic Hay, where the main character, an unsuccessful architect, reveals a model<br>of London as Christopher Wren wanted to rebuild it after the Great Fire and describes<br>how Wren was so obsessed with the opportunity the fire gave the city to rebuild itself<br>into a greater and more glorious vision. What, then, are we doing to our capital city now?<br>What have we done to it since the bombing during the war? What are we shortly going to<br>do to one of its most famous areas - Trafalgar Square? Instead of designing an extension<br>to the elegant facade of the National Gallery which complements it and continues the<br>concept of columns and domes, it looks as if we may be presented with a kind of vast<br>municipal fire station, complete with the sort of tower that contains the siren.<br>I would understand better this type of High Tech approach if you demolished the whole of<br>Trafalgar Square and started again with a single architect responsible for the entire<br>layout, but what is proposed is like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved<br>and elegant friend. Apart from anything else, it defeats me why anyone wishing to display<br>the early Renaissance pictures belonging to the gallery should do so in a new gallery so<br>manifestly at odds with the whole spirit of that age of astonishing proportion. Why can't<br>we have those curves and arches that express feeling in design? What is wrong with<br>them? Why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles -<br>and functional?<br>",

We<br>believe that he can overcome the deadly selfishness of class or sect or race by<br>discovering himself as a child of the universal God of love. When a man realizes that he<br>is a beloved child of the Creator of all, then he is ready to see his neighbours in the world<br>as brothers and sisters. That is one reason why those who dare to interpret God's will<br>must never claim him as an asset for one nation or group rather than another. War<br>springs from the love and loyalty which should be offered to God being applied to some<br>God-substitute, one of the most dangerous being nationalism.<br>This is a dangerous world where evil is at work nourishing the mindless brutality, which<br>killed and maimed so many in this city last week. Sometimes, with the greatest<br>reluctance, force is necessary to hold back the chaos which injustice and the irrational<br>element in man threaten to make of the world. But having said that, all is not lost and<br>there is hope. Even in the failure of war there are springs of hope. In that great war play<br>by Shakespeare, Henry V says: There is some soul of goodness in things evil, would men<br>observingly distill it out.' People are mourning on both sides of this conflict. In our<br>prayers we shall quite rightly remember those who are bereaved in our own country and<br>the relations of the young Argentinean soldiers who were killed. Common sorrow should<br>do something to reunite those who were engaged in this struggle. A shared anguish can<br>be a bridge of reconciliation. Our neighbours are indeed like us.<br>I have had an avalanche of letters and advice about this service. Some correspondents<br>have asked 'why drag God in?' as if the intention was to wheel up God to endorse some<br>particular policy or attitude rather than another. The purpose of prayer and of services<br>like this is very different and there is hope for the world in the difference. In our prayers<br>we come into the presence of the living God. We come with our very human emotions,<br>pride in achievement and courage, grief at loss and waste. We come as we are and not<br>just mouthing opinions and thanksgiving which the fashion of the moment judges<br>acceptable.<br>As we pour into prayer our mourning, our pride, our shame and our convictions, which<br>will inevitably differ from person to person, if we are really present and really reaching<br>out to God and not just demanding his endorsement, then God is able to work upon us.<br>He is able to deepen and enlarge our compassion and to purify our thanksgiving. The<br>parent who comes mourning the loss of a son may find here consolation, but also a spirit<br>which enlarges our compassion to include all those Argentinean parents who have lost<br>sons.<br>",

But talk of<br>peace and reconciliation is just fanciful and theoretical unless we are prepared to<br>undergo such a revolution. Many of the reports I have heard about the troops engaged in<br>this war refer to moments when soldiers have been brought face to face with what is<br>fundamental in life and have found new sources of strength and compassion even in the<br>midst of conflict. Ironically, it has sometimes been those spectators who remained at<br>home, whether supporters or opponents of the conflict, who continue to be most violent<br>in their attitudes and untouched in their deepest selves.<br>Man without God is less than man. In meeting God, a man is shown his failures and his<br>lack of integrity, but he is also given strength to turn more and more of his life and<br>actions into love and compassion for other men like himself. It is necessary to the<br>continuance of life on this planet that more and more people make this discovery. We<br>have been the choice. Man possesses the power to obliterate himself, sacrificing the<br>whole race on the altar of some God-substitute, Or he can choose life in partnership with<br>God the Father of all. I believe that there is evidence that more and more people are<br>waking up to the realization that this crucial decision peers us in the face here and now.<br>Cathedrals and churches are always places into which we bring human experiences -<br>birth, marriage, death, our flickering communion with God, our fragile relationships with<br>each other, so that they may be deepened and directed by the spirit of Christ. Today we<br>bring our mixture of thanksgiving, sorrows and aspirations for a better ordering of this<br>world.

Many people do ask, for example: When a white pop-<br>star-turned-Islamic-fanatic speaks approvingly about killing an Indian immigrant, how<br>does the Indian immigrant end up being called the racist?<br>Or, again: What minority is smaller and weaker than a minority of one?<br>I refuse to give in to despair even though, for a thousand days and more, I've been put<br>through a degree course in worthlessness, my own personal and specific worthlessness.<br>My first teachers were the mobs marching down distant boulevards, baying for my blood,<br>and finding, soon enough, their echoes on the English streets.

That even if my novel were incompetent, its<br>attempt to retell the story would still be important. That if I've failed, others must succeed,<br>because those who do not have power over the story that dominates their lives, power to<br>retell it, rethink it, deconstruct it, joke about it, and change it as times change, truly are<br>powerless, because they cannot think new thoughts.<br>",

          "And I said to myself; Admit it, Salman, the Story of Islam has a deeper meaning for you<br>than any of the other grand narratives. Of course you're no mystic, mister, and when you<br>wrote I am not a Muslim that's what you meant. No supernaturalism, no literalist<br>orthodoxies, no formal rules for you. But Islam doesn't have to mean blind faith. It can<br>mean blind faith. It can mean what it always meant in your family, a culture, a civilization,<br>as open-minded as your grandfather was, as delightedly disputatious as your father was,<br>as intellectual and philosophical as you like. Don't let zealots make Muslim a terrifying<br>word, I urged myself; remember when it meant family and light.<br>I reminded myself that I had always argued that it was necessary to develop the nascent<br>concept of the 'secular Muslim', who, like the secular Jews, affirmed his membership of<br>the culture while being separate from the theology. I had recently read the contemporary<br>Muslim philosopher Fouad Zakariya's Laicite ou Islamisme, and been encouraged by<br>Zakariya's attempt to modernize Islamic thought. But, Salman, I told myself, you can't<br>argue from outside the debating chamber. You've got to cross the threshold, go inside<br>the room, and then fight for your humanized, historicized, secularized way of being a<br>Muslim.<br>I recalled my near-namesake, the twelfth-century philosopher Ibn Rushed (Averroes),<br>who argued that (to quote the great Arab historian Albert Hourani), 'not all the words of<br>the Qu'ran should be taken literally. When the literal meaning of Qu'ranic verses<br>appeared to contradict the truths to which philosophers arrived by the exercise of reason,<br>those verses needed to be interpreted metaphorically.'<br>But Ibn Rushd was a snob. Having propounded an idea far in advance of its time, he<br>qualified it by saying that such sophistication was only suitable for the elite; literalism<br>would do for the masses. Salman, I asked myself, is it time to pick up Ibn Rushd's banner<br>and carry it forward; to say, nowadays such ideas are fit for everybody, for the beggar as<br>well as the prince?<br>It was with such things in mind - and with my thoughts in a state of some confusion and<br>torment - that I spoke the Muslim creed before witnesses. But my fantasy of joining the<br>fight for the modernization of Muslim thought, for freedom from the shackles of the<br>Thought Police, was stillborn. It never really had a chance. Too many people had spent<br>too long demonizing or totemizing me to listen seriously to what I had to say. In the west,<br>some 'friends' turned against me, called me by yet another set of insulting names. Now I<br>was spineless, pathetic, debased; I had betrayed myself, my Cause; above all, I had<br>betrayed them.<br>I also found myself up against the granite, heartless certainties of Actually Existing Islam,<br>by which I mean the political and priestly power structure that presently dominates and<br>stifles Muslim societies. Actually Existing Islam has failed to create a free society<br>anywhere on earth, and it wasn't about to let me, of all people, argue in favour of one.<br>",

That was not what I meant at all.<br>Facing the intransigence, the philistine scorn of so much of Actually Existing Islam, I<br>reluctantly concluded that there was no way for me to help bring into the Muslim culture<br>I'd dreamed of, the progressive, irreverent, skeptical, argumentative, playful and unafraid<br>culture which is what I've always understood as freedom. Not me, not in this lifetime, no<br>chance. Actually Existing Islam, which has all but deified its Prophet, a man who always<br>fought passionately against such deification; which has supplanted a priest-free religion<br>by a priest-ridden one; which makes literalism a weapon and redescriptions a crime, will<br>never let the likes of me in.<br>Ibn Rush's ideas were silenced in their time. And throughout the Muslim world today,<br>progressive ideas are in retreat. Actually Existing Islam reigns supreme, and just as the<br>recently destroyed 'Actually Existing Socialism' of the Soviet terror-state was horrifically<br>unlike the utopia of peace and equality of which democratic socialists have dreamed, so<br>also is Actually Existing Islam a force to which I have never given in, to which I cannot<br>submit.<br>There is a point beyond which conciliation looks like capitulation. I do not believe I<br>passed the point, but others have thought otherwise.<br>I have never disowned my book, nor regretted writing it. I said I was sorry to have<br>offended people, because I had not set out to do so, and so I am. I explained that writers<br>do not agree with every word spoken by every character they create - a truism in the<br>world of books, but a continuing mystery to The Satanic Verses opponents. I have always<br>said that this novel has been traduced.<br>Indeed, the chief benefit of my meeting with the six Islamic scholars on Christmas Eve<br>1990 was that they agreed that the novel had no insulting motives. 'In Islam, it is a man's<br>intention that counts,' I was told. 'Now we will launch a world-wide campaign on your<br>behalf to explain that there has been a great mistake.' All this with much smiling and<br>friendliness and handshaking. It was in this context that I agreed to suspend - not cancel<br>- a paperback edition, to create what I called a space for reconciliation.<br>",

In you, in fact, is decided that form of love which<br>all of your life will have and, through you, human life on Polish soil: the matrimonial,<br>family, social and national form - but also the priestly, religious and missionary one.<br>Every life is determined and evaluated by the interior form of love. Tell me what you love,<br>and I will tell you who you are.<br>I watch! How beautiful it is that this word is found in the call of Jasna Gora. It possesses<br>a profound evangelical ancestry: Christ says many times: 'Watch' (Matt. 26: 41). Perhaps<br>also from the Gospel it passed into the tradition of scouring. In the call of Jasna Gora it<br>is the essential element of the reply that we wish to give to the love by which we are<br>surrounded in the sign of the Sacred Icon.<br>The response to this love must be precisely the fact that I watch! What does it mean, 'I<br>watch'? It means that I make an effort to be a person with a conscience.<br>I do not stifle, this conscience and I do not deform it; I call good and evil by name, and I<br>do not blur them; I develop in myself what is good, and I seek to correct what is evil, by<br>overcoming it in myself. This is a fundamental problem which can never be minimized or<br>put on a secondary level. No! It is everywhere and always a matter of the first importance.<br>Its importance is all the greater in proportion to the increase of circumstances which<br>seem to favour our tolerance of evil and the fact that we easily excuse ourselves from<br>this, especially if adults do so.<br>My dear friends! It is up to you to put up a firm barrier against immorality, a barrier - I say<br>- to those social vices which I will not here call by name but which you yourselves are<br>perfectly aware of. You must demand this of yourselves, even if others do not demand it<br>of you. Historical experiences tell us how much the immorality of certain periods cost the<br>whole nation. Today when we are fighting for the future form of our social life, remember<br>that this form depends on what people will be like. Therefore: watch!<br>Christ said to the apostles, during his prayer in Gethsemane: 'Watch and pray that you<br>may not enter into temptation' (Matt.26: 41)<br>'I watch' also means: I see another. I do not close in on myself, in a narrow search for my<br>own interests, my own judgements. 'I watch' means: love of neighbour; it means:<br>fundamental interhuman solidarity.<br>Before the Mother of Jasna Gora I wish to give thanks for all the proofs of this solidarity<br>which have been given by my compatriots, including Polish youth, in the difficult period<br>of not many months ago. It would be difficult for me to enumerate here all the forms of<br>this solicitude which surrounded those who were interned, imprisoned, dismissed from<br>work, and also their families. You know this better than I. I received only sporadic news<br>about it.<br>",

This name defines us all. This name obliges us all. This name costs us all.<br>Perhaps at times we envy the French, the Germans or the Americans because their name<br>is not tied to such a historical price and because they are so easily free: while our Polish<br>freedom costs so much.<br>My dear ones, I will not make a comparative analysis. I will only say that it is what costs<br>that constitutes value. It is not, in fact, possible to be truly free without an honest and<br>profound relationship with values. We do not want a Poland which costs us nothing. We<br>watch, instead, beside all that makes up the authentic inheritance of the generations,<br>seeking to enrich it. A nation, then, is first of all rich in its people. Rich in man. Rich in<br>youth. Rich in every individual who watches in the name of truth: it is truth, in fact, that<br>gives form to love.<br>My dear young friends! Before our common Mother and the Queen of our hearts, I desire<br>finally to say to you that she knows your sufferings, your difficult youth, your sense of<br>injustice and humiliation, the lack of prospects for the future that is so often felt, perhaps<br>the temptations to flee to some other world.<br>Even if I am not among you every day, as was the case for many years in the past,<br>nevertheless I carry in my heart a great solicitude. A great, enormous solicitude. A<br>solicitude for you. Precisely because 'on you depends tomorrow'.<br>I pray for you every day.<br>It is good that we are here together at the hour of the call of Jasna Gora. In the midst of<br>the trials of the present time, in the midst of the trial through which your generation is<br>passing, this call of the millennium continues to be a programme.<br>In it is contained a fundamental way out.

          "Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British<br>Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors; They believe that a good king is<br>better than a bad Parliament. I have never taken that view. Others believe that the change<br>is inevitable, and that the common currency will protect us from inflation and will provide<br>a wage policy. They believe that it will control speculation and that Britain cannot survive<br>alone. None of those arguments persuade me because the argument has never been<br>about sovereignty.<br>I do not know what a sovereign is, apart from the one that used to be in gold and the<br>Pope who is sovereign in the Vatican. We are talking about democracy. No nation - not<br>even the great United States which could, for all I know, be destroyed by a nuclear<br>weapon from a third-world country - has the power to impose its will on other countries.<br>We are discussing whether the British people are to be allowed to elect those who make<br>the laws under which they are governed. The argument is nothing to do with whether we<br>should get more maternity leave from Madame Papandreou than from Madame Thatcher.<br>That is not the issue.<br>I recognize that when the members of the three Front Benches agree, I am in a minority.<br>My next job therefore is to explain to the people of Chesterfield what we have decided. I<br>will say first, 'My dear constituents, in future you will be governed by people whom you<br>do not elect and cannot remove. I am sorry about it. They may give you better creches<br>and shorter working hours but you cannot remove them.'<br>I know that it sounds negative but I have always thought it as positive to say that the<br>important thing about democracy is that we can remove without bloodshed the people<br>who govern us. We can get rid of a Callaghan, a Wilson or even a Right Hon. Lady by<br>internal processes. We can get rid of a Right Hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr Major).<br>But that cannot be done in the structure that is proposed. Even if one likes the policies of<br>the people in Europe one cannot get rid of them.<br>Secondly, we say to my favourite friends, the Chartists and suffragettes, 'All your<br>struggles to get control of the ballot box were a waste of time. We shall be run in future<br>by a few white persons, as in 1832.' The instrument, I might add, is the Royal Prerogative<br>of treaty making. For the first time since 1649 the Crown makes the laws - advised, I<br>admit, by the Prime Minister.<br>We must ask what will happen when people realize what we have done. We have had a<br>marvellous debate about Europe, but none of us has discussed our relationship with the<br>people who sent us here. Hon. Members have expressed views on Albania and the Baltic<br>states. I have been dazzled by the knowledge of the continent of which we are all part. NO<br>one has spoken about how he or she got here and what we were sent here to do.<br>",

          "If people lose the power to sack their Government one of several things happens. First,<br>people may just slope off. Apathy could destroy democracy. When the turnout drops<br>below 50 per cent, we are in danger...<br>The second thing that people can do is to riot. Riot is an old-fashioned method for<br>drawing the attention of the Government to what is wrong. It is difficult for an elected<br>person to admit it, but the riot at Strangeways produced some prison reforms. Riot has<br>historically played a much larger part in British politics than we are ever allowed to know.<br>Thirdly, nationalism can arise. Instead of blaming the Treaty of Rome, people say, 'It is<br>those Germans' or 'It is the French'.<br>Nationalism is built out of frustration that people feel when they cannot get their way<br>through the ballot box. With nationalism comes repression. I hope that it is not<br>pessimistic - in my view it is not - to say that democracy hangs by a thread in every<br>country of the world. Unless we can offer people a peaceful route to the resolution of<br>injustices through the ballot box they will not listen to a House that has blocked off that<br>route.<br>There are many alternatives open to us. One Hon. Member said that he was young and<br>had not fought in the war. He looked at a new Europe. But there have been five Europes<br>this century. There was one run by the King, the Kaiser and the Tsar - they were all<br>cousins so that was very comfortable. They were all Queen Victoria's grandsons. And<br>there was no nonsense about human rights when Queen Victoria's grandsons repressed<br>people. Then there was the Russian revolution. Then there was the inter-war period. Then<br>there was the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Then there was the cold war. Now we have a Boris<br>Yeltsin who has joined the Monday Club. There have been so many Europes. This is not<br>the only Europe on offer.<br>I understand that my Hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr Mulliri) is a<br>democratic federalist, as is my Hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr<br>Barnes). They want an American-type constitution for Europe. It could be that our laws<br>would hang on which way the Albanian members voted. I could not complain about that<br>because that is democracy. However, it is unworkable. It is like trying to get an elephant<br>to dance through a minefield. But it would be democratic.<br>",

          "Another way would be to have a looser, wider Europe. I have an idea for a<br>Commonwealth of Europe. I am introducing a bill on the subject. Europe would be rather<br>like the British Common-wealth. We would work by consent with people. Or we could<br>accept this ghastly proposal, which is clumsy, secretive, centralized, bureaucratic and<br>divisive. That is how I regard the Treaty of Rome. I was born a European and I will die one.<br>But I have never put my alliance behind the Treaty of Rome. I object to it. I hate being<br>called an anti-European. How can one be anti-European when one is born in Europe? It is<br>like saying that one is anti-British if one does not agree with the Chancellor of the<br>Exchequer.<br>What a lot of nonsense it is.<br>I ask myself why the House is ready to contemplate abandoning its duties, as I fear that it<br>is. I was elected forty-one years ago this month. This Chamber has lost confidence in<br>democracy. It believes that it must be governed by someone else. It is afraid to use the<br>powers entrusted to it by its constituents. It has traded power for status. One gets asked<br>to go on the telly if one is a Member of Parliament. The Chamber does not want to use its<br>power. It has accepted the role of a spectator and joined what Bagehot called the<br>dignified part of the constitution, leaving the Crown, under the control of the Prime<br>Minister, to be the Executive part.<br>If democracy is destroyed in Britain it will be not the communists, Trotskyists or<br>subversives but this House which threw it away. The rights that are entrusted to us are<br>not for us to give away. Even if I agree with everything that is proposed, I cannot hand<br>away powers lent to me for five years by the people of Chesterfield. I just could not do it.<br>It would be theft of public rights.<br>Therefore, there is only one answer. If people are determined to submit themselves to<br>Jacques Delors, Madame Papandreou and the Council of Ministers, we must tell the<br>people what is planned. If people vote for that, they will all have capitulated. Julius<br>Caesar said, 'We are just merging our sovereignty.' So did William the Conqueror.<br>It is not possible to support the Government's motion. I have told the Chief Whip that I<br>cannot support the Labour motion. I invite the House to vote against the Government's<br>motion and not to support a motion which purports to take us faster into a Community<br>which cannot reflect the aspirations of those who put us here. That is not a nationalist<br>argument nor is it about sovereignty. It is a democratic argument and it should be<br>decisive in a democratic Chamber.<br>",

          "As long ago as 1962 it was Lord Stockton, formerly Harold Macmillan, who first put the<br>central point clearly. He argued that we had to place and keep ourselves within the<br>Community. He saw it as essential then as it is today not to cut ourselves off from the<br>realities of power, not to retreat into a ghetto of sentimentality about our past and so<br>diminish our control over our own destiny in the future.<br>The pity is that the Macmillan view had not been perceived more clearly a decade before<br>in the fifties. It would have spared so many of the struggles of the past twenty years had<br>we been in the Community from the outset, had we been ready, in the much too simple<br>phrase, to surrender some sovereignty at a much earlier stage.<br>Had we been in from the start we should have had more not less influence over the<br>Europe in which we live today. We should never forget the lesson of that isolation, of<br>being on the outside looking in, for the conduct of today's affairs.<br>We have done best when we have seen the Community not as a static entity to be<br>resisted and contained, but as an active process which we can shape often decisively<br>provided we allow ourselves to be fully engaged in it with confidence and enthusiasm<br>and in good faith.<br>We must at all costs avoid presenting ourselves yet again with an over-simplified choice,<br>a false antithesis, a bogus dilemma, between one alternative starkly labelled 'cooperation<br>between independent sovereign states' and a second equally crudely labelled alternative<br>'a centralized federal super-state' as if there were no middle way in between.<br>We commit a serious error if we think always in terms of surrendering sovereignty and<br>seek to stand pat for all time on a given deal by proclaiming, as the prime minister did<br>two weeks ago, that we have surrendered enough. The European enterprise is not and<br>should not be seen like that, as some kind of zero sum gain.<br>Sir Winston Churchill put it much more positively forty years ago when he said: 'Is it not<br>possible and not less agreeable to regard this sacrifice or merger of national sovereignty<br>as the gradual assumption by all the nations concerned of that larger sovereignty which<br>can alone protect their diverse and distinctive customs and characteristics and their<br>national traditions?'<br>I find Winston Churchill's perception a good deal more convincing and encouraging for<br>the interests of our nation than the nightmare image sometimes conjured up by the prime<br>minister who sometimes seems to look out on a Continent that is positively teeming with<br>ill-intentioned people scheming, in her words, to extinguish democracy, to dissolve our<br>national identity, to lead us through the back door into a federal Europe.<br>",

We must be positively and centrally involved in this debate and<br>not fearfully and negatively detached. The cost of disengagement here could be very<br>serious indeed...<br>The tragedy is - and it is for me personally, for my party, for our whole people, for the<br>prime minister herself a very real tragedy - that the prime minister's perceived attitude<br>towards Europe is running increasingly serious risks for the future of our nation.

If we detach ourselves completely as a party or as a<br>nation from the middle ground of Europe, the effects will be incalculable and very hard<br>ever to correct.<br>In my letter of resignation, which I tendered with the utmost sadness and dismay, I said<br>that cabinet government is about trying to persuade one another from within. That was<br>my commitment to government by persuasion, persuading colleagues and nation.<br>I have tried to do that as foreign secretary and since, but realize now that the task has<br>become futile, of trying to stretch the meaning of words beyond what was credible, of<br>trying to pretend there was a common policy when every step forward risked being<br>subverted by some casual comment or impulsive answer.<br>The conflict of loyalty is loyalty to the prime minister - and after more than two decades<br>together that instinct of loyalty is still very real - and the loyalty to what I perceive to be<br>the true interests of this nation.<br>That conflict of loyalty has become all too great. I no longer believe it is possible to<br>resolve that conflict from within this government. That is why I have resigned.<br>In doing so I have done what I believe to be right for my party and my country.

It will<br>happen - if we make it happen.<br>I ask you - ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters - for the good of all of us - for the<br>love of this great nation, for the family of America - for the love of God, please, make this<br>nation remember how futures are built.<br>",

        Content:
          "At long last I am able to say a few words of my own. I have never wanted to withhold<br>anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.<br>A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as king and emperor, and now that I have been<br>succeeded by my brother, the duke of York, my first words must be to declare my<br>allegiance to him. This I do with all my heart.<br>You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne. But I want you<br>to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country or the empire,<br>which, as prince of Wales and lately as king, I have for twenty-five years tried to serve.<br>But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy<br>burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without<br>the help and support of the woman I love.<br>And I want you to know that the decision I have made has been mine and mine alone.<br>This was a thing I had to judge entirely for myself. The other person most nearly<br>concerned has tried up to the last minute to persuade me to take a different course.<br>I have made this, the most serious decision of my life, only upon the single thought of<br>what would, in the end, be best for all.<br>This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother,<br>with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities, will<br>be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress<br>of the empire. And he has one matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of you, and not<br>bestowed on me-a happy home with his wife and children.<br>During these hard days I have been comforted by Her Majesty my mother and by my<br>family. The ministers of the crown and, in particular, Mr. Baldwin, the prime minister, have<br>always treated me with full consideration.<br>There has never been any constitutional difference between me and them, and between<br>me and Parliament. Bred in the constitutional tradition by my father, I should never have<br>allowed any such issue to arise.<br>Ever since I was prince of Wales, and later on when I occupied the throne, I have been<br>treated with the greatest kindness by all classes of the people wherever I have lived or<br>journeyed throughout the empire. For that I am very grateful.<br>I now quit altogether public affairs, and I lay down my burden. It may be some time<br>before I return to my native land, but I shall always follow the fortunes of the British race<br>and empire with profound interest, and if at any time in the future I can be found of<br>service to His Majesty in a private station, I will not fail.<br>And now, we all have a new king. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and<br>prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all! God save the king!<br>",

          "There were hard hours on our journey, and often we sailed against the wind. But always<br>we kept our rudder true, and there were so many of you who stayed the course and<br>shared our hope. You gave your help; but even more, you gave your hearts.<br>Because of you, this has been a happy campaign. You welcomed Joan, me and our family<br>into your homes and neighbourhoods, your churches, your campuses, your union halls.<br>When I think back of all the miles and all the months and all the memories, I think of you.<br>I recall the poet's words, and I say: What golden friends I have.<br>Among you, my golden friends across this land, I have listened and learned.<br>I have listened to Kenny Dubois, a glassblower from Charleston, West Virginia, who has<br>ten children to support but has lost his job after thirty-five years, just three years short of<br>qualifying for his pension...<br>I have listened to the grandmother in East Oakland who no longer has a phone to call her<br>grandchildren because she gave it up to pay the rent on her small apartment.<br>I have listened to young workers out of work, to students without the tuition for college,<br>and to families without the chance to own a home. I have seen the closed factories and<br>the stalled assembly lines of Anderson, Indiana and South Gate, California, and I have<br>seen too many, far too many idle men and women desperate to work. I have seen too<br>many, far too many working families desperate to protect the value of their wages from<br>the ravages of inflation.<br>Yet I have also sensed a yearning for new hope among the people in every state where I<br>have been. And I have felt it in their handshakes, I saw it in their faces, and I shall never<br>forget the mothers who carried children to our rallies. I shall always remember the elderly<br>who have lived in an America of high purpose and who believe that it can all happen<br>again.<br>Tonight, in their name, I have come here to speak for them. And for their sake, I ask you<br>to stand with them. On their behalf I ask you to restate and reaffirm the timeless truth of<br>our party.<br>I congratulate President Carter on his victory here. I am confident that the Democratic<br>Party will reunite on the basis of Democratic principles, and that together we will march<br>towards a Democratic victory in 1980.<br>And someday, long after this convention, long after the signs come down, and the<br>crowds stop cheering, and the bands stop playing, may it be said of our campaign that<br>we kept the faith. May it be said of our party in 1980 that we found our faith again.<br>And may it be said of us, both in dark passages and in bright days, in the words of<br>Tennyson that my brothers quoted and loved, and that have special meaning for me now:<br>'I am a part of all that I have met/ Tho'much is taken, much abides/That which we are, we<br>are -/One equal temper of heroic hearts/strong in will/To strive, to seek, to find, and not to<br>yield...'<br>For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end. For all those whose cares have<br>been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the<br>dream shall never die.<br>",
